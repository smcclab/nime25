## Review Phases

The review time deadlines are above but here is an explanation about each phase:

- **Reviewer Invitations**: Before the submission deadline and directly after, track chairs invite reviewers and meta-reviewers via the submission system (CMT). Invitations are normally sent to previous NIME reviewers and volunteers from the community, particularly authors of submissions.
- **Reviewer Allocation**: Directly after the submission deadline, track chairs organise reviewer allocations with a goal of organising allocations in one week. In general, reviewers are allocated 2-4 submissions per track that they are involved with. Meta-reviewers are often responsible for 5-10 submissions.
- **Identify Un-reviewable submissions**: Track chairs will do an initial pass through submissions to identify those that are not reviewable (see reviewer guides). The submissions are removed from the system (desk rejected) so as to not waste reviewer time and provide early feedback to authors.
- **Review Phase**: Reviewers consider their assigned submissions, write reviews and answer questions in the review form. Meta-reviewers read and consider the submissions.
- **Discussion Phase**: Reviewers and Meta-reviewer are now able to see completed reviews. The meta-reviewer leads a discussion in CMT between the reviewers to see if a consensus can be found. If there is no consensus or the meta-reviewer disagrees with the reviewers, a second meta reviewer may also consider the submission.
- **Meta-review Phase**: The meta-reviewer submits their meta-review and an Accept/Reject recommendation to the track chairs.
- **Decision Phase**: Track chairs make final Accept/Reject decisions based on meta-reviews and available space in the conference program.
- **Decisions and Reviews Released**: Final decisions from track chairs, reviews and meta-reviews are released to authors.

## Expectations for Paper Track Submission Types

Papers are expected to have a contribution commensurate with their length. Here are some guidelines for assessing contributions:

- **6000 words (long)**: Submissions that are comparable in contribution to previous long or 6-page papers at NIME. These would feature original and innovative technologies or ideas and robust scholarly support that may be a form of evaluation or supporting argument. 

- **4000 words (medium)**: Submissions that are comparable in contribution to previous short or 4-page papers at NIME. These would feature original and innovative technologies or ideas and robust scholarly support but would typically have a smaller scope or depth than _long_ papers.

- **2000 words (short)**: Submissions that could propose an original or innovative technology, technical approach, prototype, idea or other novel contribution. They may not have an accompanying evaluation or have one of limited scope. The submission should nevertheless suggest a meaningful contribution to NIME. 

All submissions are expected to be completed to a high scholarly standard including references, clearly articulated text, and excellent formatting.

All submissions are eligible for oral or poster presentation if accepted.

## Expectations for Music Track Submission Types

Music submissions are expected to expand and reshape our understanding of NIME in the performance, conceptualisation, and reception of music. This year, the music track includes live and remote performances as well as installations. Reviewers should be aware of the submitters’ chosen performance type.

- **Live Performance**: Live performances should involve the author and/or collaborators performing in-person at NIME comparable to traditional NIME performances. Feasibility could relate to how the performance and its technical requirements might fit within a busy conference concert program. 

- **Remote Performance**: Remote performances may involve an online connection to an artist not present at NIME, or some other method of performing remotely. Remote performance submissions need to clearly document the technical requirements to produce the work at NIME. Feasibility could include consideration of technical requirements at the NIME end given that the author would not be present to set up equipment.

- **Installation**: Installations could include physical works to be exhibited in foyer, room, or gallery spaces as well as virtual works that exist online. The technical requirements and setup for the installation should be clear from the submission. Feasibility should include consideration of technical scope and space requirements with equipment that the author would contribute. The chairs will consider all submissions on their merits but, as an example, an installation involving a single screen and stereo pair of monitor speakers would be more feasible than one involving 8 screens and 32 speakers.

## Contacting Track Chairs

If you have a problem with a particular submission, for example you can't access some aspect of it or find that you have a conflict of interest, please contact the track chairs for that submission. 

You can do this very easily within the CMT reviewer console by clicking the envelope icon which appears to the right of each submission, for example as in this image:

![Screenshot of CMT showing the link to email track chairs, in this case the "Music" track.]({% link assets/cmt-email-track-chairs.jpg %})

Clicking this link will allow you to email the chairs for that track, including information about teh submission, who can take action to resolve the problem.

## NIME reviews build our community

NIME is a genuinely interdisciplinary community studying how, why and what it means to make music with computers. 
The NIME community includes technologists, academics, artists, musicians, experimental practitioners, theorists, students, teachers and others.
For this reason, it's important to approach NIME reviews with a community perspective; for example, a paper may not be the kind of work you like, or what you’re used to seeing but may still be valuable to the community. 
We ask reviewers to approach every submission with an open mind and intellectual generosity, and decide **whether the submission presents a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge.**

We want NIME to be the place where we can send our work trusting that it will be given a fair and open-minded evaluation. Ideally, NIME authors should never feel that "the reviewers just didn't get it".


## Bias and interdisciplinarity

NIME not immune to the effects of conscious and unconscious bias. While we can't guarantee to avoid bias, please keep in mind that we all have our own expectations what makes a submission “good”, “useful”, and “relevant”. NIME is a diverse community that lies across disciplines, and you may encounter submissions that you don’t personally find useful or relevant. In this case, we encourage all reviewers to keep in mind that our judgement should be based on **enhancing community knowledge**.

Contributions come from different research traditions (qualitative, quantitative, design-based and artistic research, etc). It is not usually possible to have 100% matches between reviewers and submissions. While we hope that many in our community have a broad perspective on NIME works, please keep an eye open for critical mismatches. If you feel you cannot review an allocated submission, let your track chair know.


# What to do as a NIME reviewer

You'll get an email when the reviews have been assigned, and you can submit your reviews any time between then and the review deadline. Note that you will start to receive reminders of increasing urgency and frequency in the week before the review deadline. To avoid email reminders, submit your reviews early!

### Accessing and viewing submissions

Please make sure you can access the submission system (CMT), change your role to "reviewer" (top right corner) and view all submissions allocated to you. Check that you can download the submissions and supplementary files that may be available.

If there is a critical issue with a submission allocated to you. For example, a [conflict of interest](), or it is [not reviewable]() for some reason, please use the submission system to email the meta-reviewer and/or track chairs. It is good to check submissions early for issues.

Of course, we expect reviewers to read/view all submissions including supplementary material that might be included.

### Write your review

Please note: The goal of reviews is not to eliminate papers from consideration. Rather, it is to help identify the papers that offer important contributions to community knowledge. In general, a good review will:

**Summarise the paper**: Writing a few sentences summarising the paper helps the meta-reviewers contextualise the submission and indicates to the author how readers perceive their work.

**Identify strengths**: It's very important to clearly articulate strengths of a paper, particularly when it is a strong submission but also when has many weaknesses. Part of a reviewers role is to **find** the contributions and positive aspects of a submission, especially when these are not obvious.

**Identify weaknesses**: Weaknesses of a paper should be clearly articulated. If there are methodological issues, we suggest providing references from the NIME archive indicating best practice.

**Provide guidance for improvement**: The review should indicate how authors could improve the work, e.g., what differences might be practically made to solve shortcomings. It is appropriate to identify minor formatting or content fixes that should be fixed before any potential publication but please remember that NIME papers are generally not updated significantly between review and publication if accepted.

### Make a rating

NIME submissions can have one of four ratings:

- Reject
- Lean Reject
- Lean Accept
- Accept

Note that there is no "neutral" rating. Reviewers are asked to make a decision about whether you recommend acceptance or not.

It's very important that your review and rating are well aligned. That is, if you recommend "4. Accept" but have a review that only covers weaknesses you are not providing a reason for the meta-reviewer and track chair to believe your recommendation.

### Tips for Paper Track Reviewers

- **TODO**

### Tips for Music Track Reviewers

- **Quality** 

- **Feasibility**: Music submissions require an assessment of feasibility. This refers to how practical it is to produce and present the music work at NIME. Reviewers do not have very detailed information about the spaces or equipment available so this decision should be made on the basis of how feasible it would be to present at within a normal university or concert hall environment. Aspects that might be less feasible would include: requiring an unreasonable amount of equipment where specific equipment is not identified in the call (e.g., 100 loudspeakers), potentially hazardous elements (e.g., including fire or travelling with biological specimens), human or animal ethical concerns (the performance will require six cats, members of the audience will be randomly electrocuted).

### Tips for Workshop Reviewers

- **Anonymity**: Workshop submissions are not anonymous as it is not practical to include anonymised information related to the presenters.


## What to do as a NIME meta-reviewer

As a meta-reviewers you won’t have to find a group of reviewers; these will be assigned for you after the submission deadline.
During the review phase you are expected to read/watch the submissions assigned to you so that you are aware of the work you are evaluating.

Meta-reviews must contact reviewers and remind them of the review deadline if their reviews are not submitted. Track chairs will also send email reminders but it's a good idea to have many reminders as the deadline approaches. By the review deadline reviews should be complete (score, as well as written review). Meeting this deadline is very important.

After the reviews are in, the meta-reviewers have about a week to read the submitted reviews, lead discussions with reviewers to resolve disagreements, and write the meta-review.

### Writing a NIME meta-review

Meta-reviews give track chairs a summary of the reviewer perspectives (including the meta-reviewers' own) and a recommendation for or against acceptance at NIME.

The central, guiding question for all reviews---meta or otherwise---is this: **Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge?** 

### Read the submission

It seems self-explanatory, but it’s important to read the submission, in its entirety. Some useful questions to ask yourself while you read:

*   What’s the central idea in this paper? Is it clear?
*   What’s the contribution that this paper makes?
*   Is the contribution unique? (This doesn’t mean it’s never been written about before, but rather that there’s something here that is singular---that could be an implementation, a technical aspect, an evaluation technique, a theoretical perspective, an artistic take, etc)
*   Does the contribution add value to the NIME body of knowledge?

### Read the reviews

After reading the submission, carefully read the written reviews and scores. It is important to identify whether the review comments align with the score and whether multiple reviewers identify the same strengths and weaknesses in a paper. Reviewers are often better at finding weaknesses than strengths so its a good idea to clearly identify what contributions each submission is attempting/succeeding to make.

It's also important to identify reviews that do not meet our standards. One sentence reviews are unacceptable and counter-productive as are reviews that focus only on negative aspects or conversely that accept submissions on face value without critical engagement.

### Discussion with reviewers

All submissions should have a discussion between reviewers and meta-reviewer even if just to say "we clearly all agree this is the best paper ever, thanks for your contribution to NIME.". 
More likely, review scores will vary and the meta-reviewer should prompt reviewers for their perspectives to inform a recommendation. A consensus might be found between the reviewers on reflection and on consideration of the other reviews.

As the meta-review has considerable influence, it’s important to fully understand, consider and synthesise the reviewers’ perspectives so your meta-review reflects not only your own expertise but the opinions of the reviewers.
At this point please let reviewers know if their reviews can be improved to provide more value to the author, e.g., by being a bit longer.

### Writing the meta-review

The meta-review should: 

1. Point out strengths of the submission identified by the reviewers as well as by you.
2. Identify weaknesses of the submission identified by the reviewers as well as by you.
3. Offer a perspective on whether the submission makes a valid, meaningful contribution to NIME and should or shouldn't be accepted.
4. Provide clear feedback on critical improvements that must be made before acceptance (in a case of conditional acceptance).

Your review should support your acceptance recommendation. Clearly state why you are making your recommendation, and provide evidence from the other reviewers.

### Make an acceptance recommendation

The meta-reviewer's score has three options:

- Accept
- Conditionally accept
- Reject

Note that conditional acceptance should only be used in a small minority of submissions where a **critical improvement** must be made. Track chairs will not permit a large number of "conditional accept" ratings as our review process does not have capacity to re-review a large number of submissions.

### An example meta-review

Below is an example of a useful meta-review:

> This paper is on the usefulness of thematic analysis in instrument evaluation. The authors performed a thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews of six experimental musicians. Through this method, they found that there were new insights that are not captured by other methods such as surveys.
>
> This work has several strong points. For example, Reviewers 1 and 2 point out that this submission provides a solid primer on thematic analysis and how it can be applied to the evaluation of NIME work. Reviewer 1 adds that the method is rigorous, and the authors demonstrate their deep engagement with thematic analysis. I agree with these assessments.
>
> That said, the reviewers pointed out several drawbacks to this work. First of all, all reviewers mentioned that the authors do not engage with NIME work that has used this method before. \[Give examples.\] Reviewer 2 suggests that citing some of these works in the Background would communicate awareness of this work, and provide an opportunity for the authors to explain how this method is different. Secondly, Reviewers 1 and 2 add that while the authors claim that new insights are possible that go beyond what’s able to be captured by surveys, there is no comparison of methods in order to make a credible claim. Though I don’t think that this demonstration is strictly necessary in every case, unfortunately this is the main stated contribution of this paper, and I agree that this claim is not well supported.
>
> For this reason, my recommendation for this paper is Reject. This is because there is already ample work on using thematic analysis for instrument evaluation, and this submission does not go beyond that existing work, except with the claim of better insights which is unfortunately unsupported. I encourage the authors to read the insightful and important critiques submitted by the reviewers, and to re-submit this work in the future - there is a kernel of a good idea here, and with more support of the paper’s claims (or an alternative framing) this could be a very useful contribution.

### Fill in other fields and feedback.

There are other fields in the meta-review form that are optional:

**Please enter justification for your decision here (this will NOT be shared with the authors but only visible to the NIME chairs)** Meta reviewers should comment on their final decision to the track chairs. This can be simple as agreement with the reviewers or include other perspectives that should be considered in this decision.

**Are any changes required to the submission format? (e.g. length, formatting, ethics statement)** This field is to list minor formatting and content suggestions for authors. Information here should not be serious enough to merit a conditional acceptance but is just to help authors meet formatting and presentation quality standards at NIME or, if rejected, at another publication venue.

# Review Frequently Asked Questions

### Is review anonymous? {#anonymous}

The NIME review process for music and paper tracks is double-blind. This means that the authors don’t know who the reviewers are.

The workshop track is generally single-blind so reviewers can see authors identities but authors do not know who the reviewers are.

### What should I do if I recognise the work I’m being asked to review? {#recognise}

When you volunteer for reviewing you are asked to state your conflicts of interest, meaning people that you work closely with now, or those you’ve worked closely with in the past. This information is used to avoid direct conflicts of interest in reviewer allocation, but as we are a small field, we often know about research from our international friends without having worked or published with them leading to recognition of work during review.

If this happens, email the meta-reviewer or track chair. In some cases another reviewer may be required. In other cases, it may be that although you recognise a system or research theme, you do not actually know who the authors are (e.g., different students or team members are involved with a similar stream of research work over the years).

### What should I do if I feel completely unqualified to assess this submission? {#unqualified}

Though we try to match the specialisation of reviewers to the submissions, you might get a review on a subject you don’t know very much about, or one using methods or coming from a research tradition you are not familiar with or comfortable evaluating.

Here good reviews are essential! A summary of the paper, what you understand from it as someone without expertise in this area, and what you see as strengths and weaknesses is very useful and provides important author feedback.

If you are really not comfortable reviewing it because doing so requires specific topical or methodological expertise, please contact your meta-reviewer or track chairs.

### How long should a review be?

Typically NIME reviews are 200-600 words, but reviews have a recommended structure: It should summarise the paper’s topic and main points, state the positive and negative aspects, and offer a recommendation for acceptance with a well-articulated reasoning for that recommendation. 

Very short reviews (less than 100 words) are generally not acceptable. Very long reviews (e.g., more than 1500 words), while often well-meaning, can be overwhelming to authors given. In both cases a meta-reviewer may ask reviewers to edit their review.

### If the paper is great, do I need to submit a detailed review?

Yes! Authors depend on feedback, and explaining why you thought something was great is as important as a less positive critique.
It's vitally important to justify **what** is great about a submission and **why** so that a meta-reviewer can use this information to justify acceptance.

### What happens if the paper content is valuable, but the writing isn’t good?

We ask that reviewers focus on the _content_ of the paper. Meta-reviewers will make the call about whether the writing is a factor.

Please note: In recent years there has been an effort within NIME to offer peer proofreading, to include submissions from people whose English is not their first language but whose content makes important contributions. After review, meta-reviewers will decide whether the paper should undergo proofreading.

### What makes a paper unreviewable (desk rejected)? {#unreviewable}

Papers are removed from review at the beginning of the process (known as a “desk reject”) for the following reasons:

* The authors names are included (i.e., the paper is not anonymised)
* The paper is not submitted in English
* The paper is obviously not complete (i.e., section headings but no content)
* The paper has clear ethical issues (i.e., the study creates some clear danger for participant, or no previous ethical approval was obtained)
    
These are the only situations in which there can be a desk rejection. Otherwise, the paper goes to review. Decisions to remove a paper from the review process are serious and so must be agreed by two chairs (track or general) of the conference. 

On the positive side, early feedback can give authors a chance to solve critical issues and resubmit to another venue quickly.

### What happens if I don’t submit a review? {#nonsubmission}

Since NIME is dependent on reviews to select the proceedings, we ask you to please, please submit your reviews if you have committed to reviewing for this year’s NIME.

If for some reason reviewing is impossible, please tell your meta-reviewer as soon as possible so another reviewer can  be found.
If you fail to submit reviews without explanation, you may not be invited to review in future.

### Can the results of the reviewing process be contested? 

Since NIME is a small conference with limited resources, we don’t offer a rebuttal phase for reviews. Once the reviews are released, the decisions are final.
