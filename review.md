## Reviewers and Meta-Reviewers

There are two types of reviewers at NIME: Reviewers, and meta-reviewers, both of which are equally vital to the quality of the NIME proceedings. 

**Reviewers** are peers within the NIME community who assess submissions on the basis of quality. In general, all NIME submissions are assigned three reviewers to gather a range of perspectives. Reviewers generally have experience presenting or publishing in the NIME conference or related scholarly venues or events and have experience (e.g., completing graduate studies) that objectively qualify them in peer evaluation.

**Meta-reviewers** are experienced NIME scholars and artists with considerable domain knowledge and reviewing experience. Meta-reviewers consider the reviewers' perspectives and their own assessment of a submission to _make an acceptance recommendation to the track chairs_. Meta-reviewers do not simply _average_ reviwers' scores but can engage the reviewers in discussion as well as contribute their own perspective to reach a consensus and ensure that feedback to authors is appropriate.

## A community perspective for NIME reviews

NIME is a genuinely interdisciplinary community studying how, why and what it means to make music with computers. 
The NIME community includes technologists, academics, artists, musicians, experimental practitioners, theorists, students, teachers and others.
For this reason, it’s important to approach NIME reviews with a community perspective; for example, a paper may not be the kind of work you like, or what you’re used to seeing but may still be valuable to the community. 
We ask reviewers to approach every submission with an open mind and intellectual generosity, and decide **whether the submission presents a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge.**

We want NIME to be the place where we can send our work trusting that it will be given a fair and open-minded evaluation. Ideally, NIME authors should never feel that "the reviewers just didn't get it".

## The review timeline

The review time deadlines are above but here is an explanation about each phase:

- **Reviewer Invitations**: Before the submission deadline and directly after, track chairs invite reviewers and meta-reviewers via the submission system (CMT). Invitations are normally sent to previous NIME reviewers and volunteers from the community, particularly authors of submissions.
- **Reviewer Allocation**: Directly after the submission deadline, track chairs organise reviewer allocations with a goal of organising allocations in one week. In general, reviewers are allocated 2-4 submissions per track that they are involved with. Meta-reviewers are often responsible for 5-10 submissions.
- **Identify Un-reviewable submissions**: Track chairs will do an initial pass through submissions to identify those that are not reviewable (see details below). The submissions are removed from the system (desk rejected) so as to not waste reviewer time and provide early feedback to authors.
- **Review Phase**: Reviewers consider their assigned submissions, write reviews and answer questions in the review form. Meta-reviewers read and consider the submissions.
- **Discussion Phase**: Reviewers and Meta-reviewer are now able to see completed reviews. The meta-reviewer leads a discussion in CMT between the reviewers to see if a consensus can be found. If there is no consensus or the meta-reviewer disagrees with the reviewers, a second meta reviewer may also consider the submission.
- **Meta-review Phase**: The meta-reviewer submits their meta-review and an Accept/Reject recommendation to the track chairs.
- **Decision Phase**: Track chairs make final Accept/Reject decisions based on meta-reviews and available space in the conference program.
- **Decisions and Reviews Released**: Final decisions from track chairs, reviews and meta-reviews are released to authors.

## What to do as a NIME reviewer

You’ll get an email when the reviews have been assigned, and you can submit your reviews any time between then and the review deadline.

### Review structure    

Please note: The goal of reviews is not to eliminate papers from consideration. Rather, it is to help identify the papers that offer important contributions to community knowledge. In general, a good review will:

#### 1: Summarise the paper

Writing a few sentences summarising the paper is a great way to start. It demonstrates to the author that you read and considered the paper, and is a good jumping-off point for your own thoughts.

#### 2: Summarise the positives.

Every paper, no matter how lacking, has positive aspects - maybe it’s well written, or it provides an excellent bibliography, or contains great documentation or illustrations. 

**A meta-review should summarise the positives pointed out by each reviewer, as well as any additional strengths identified by you.**

#### 3: Summarise the negatives, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

Summarise any negative aspects, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

**A meta-review should summarise the weak points pointed out by each reviewer, as well as any additional areas for improvement identified by you.**

### A note about bias and interdisciplinarity

In recent years the topic of bias has come to the forefront in peer review, and NIME of course is not immune to the effects of conscious and unconscious bias.

We can't guarantee to avoid bias, but please keep in mind that we all have our own expectations of NIME work that is “good”, “useful”, and “relevant”. NIME is an enormous and diverse community that lies across divergent disciplines, and you may encounter submissions that you don’t personally find useful or relevant. In this case, we encourage all reviewers to keep in mind that our judgement should be based on **enhancing community knowledge**.

Contributions come from different research traditions (qualitative, quantitative, design-based and artistic research, etc). It is not usually possible to have 100% matches between reviewers and submissions. While we hope that many in our community have a broad perspective on NIME works, please keep an eye open for critical mismatches. If you feel you cannot review an allocated submission, let your track chair known.

## What to do as a NIME meta-reviewer

As a meta-reviewers you won’t have to find a group of reviewers; these will be assigned for you after the submission deadline.
During the review phase you are expected to read/watch the submissions assigned to you so that you are aware of the work you are evaluating.

As a meta-reviewer, it’s your responsibility to contact reviewers and remind them of the review deadline if their reviews are not submitted. Track chairs will also send email reminders but it's a good idea to have many reminders as the deadline approaches. By the review deadline reviews should be complete (score, as well as written review). Meeting this deadline is very important.

After the reviews are in, the meta-reviewers have about a week to read the submitted reviews, lead discussions with reviewers to resolve disagreements, and write the meta-review.

### Writing a NIME meta-review

Meta-reviews give track chairs a summary of the reviewer perspectives (including the meta-reviewers' own) and a recommendation for or against acceptance at NIME.

The central, guiding question for all reviews - meta or otherwise - is this:

**Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to NIME community knowledge?** 

With this question in mind, here’s a guide to writing a NIME meta-review. 

### Read the submission

It seems self-explanatory, but it’s important to read the submission, in its entirety. Some useful questions to ask yourself while you read:

*   What’s the central idea in this paper? Is it clear?
*   What’s the contribution that this paper makes?
*   Is the contribution unique? (This doesn’t mean it’s never been written about before, but rather that there’s something here that is singular - that could be an implementation, a technical aspect, an evaluation technique, a theoretical perspective, an artistic take, etc)
*   Does the contribution add value to the NIME body of knowledge?

### Read the reviews

After reading the submission, carefully read the written reviews and scores. It is important to identify whether the review comments align with the score and whether multiple reviewers identify the same strengths and weaknesses in a paper. Reviewers are often better at finding weaknesses than strengths so its a good idea to clearly identify what contributions each submission is attempting/succeeding to make.

It's also important to identify reviews that do not meet our standards. One sentence reviews are unacceptable and counter-productive as are reviews that focus only on negative aspects or conversely that accept submissions on face value without critical engagement.

### Discussion with reviewers

All submissions should have a discussion between reviewers and meta-reviewer even if just to say "we clearly all agree this is the best paper ever, thanks for your contribution to NIME.". 
More likely, review scores will vary and the meta-reviewer should prompt reviewers for their perspectives to inform a recommendation. A consensus might be found between the reviewers on reflection and on consideration of the other reviews.

As the meta-review has considerable influence, it’s important to fully understand, consider and synthesise the reviewers’ perspectives so your meta-review reflects not only your own expertise but the opinions of the reviewers.
At this point please let reviewers know if their reviews can be improved to provide more value to the author, e.g., by being a bit longer.

### Writing the meta-review

The meta-review should: 

1. Point out strengths of the submission identified by the reviewers as well as by you.
2. Identify weaknesses of the submission identified by the reviewers as well as by you.
3. Offer a perspective on whether the submission makes a valid, meaningful contribution to NIME and should or shouldn't be accepted.
4. Provide clear feedback on critical improvements that must be made before acceptance (in a case of conditional acceptance).

Your review should support your acceptance recommendation. Clearly state why you are making this recommendation, and make sure that you take into account the opinions of the reviewers. For example, if your reviewers score a paper 3, 3, and 4 but you think it’s a very good and important work, state why you think so and what this unique and important contribution to the NIME community is. This information is helpful for the author and critically important for track chairs.

### Make an acceptance recommendation

The meta-reviewer's score has three options:

- Accept
- Conditionally accept
- Reject

Note that conditional acceptance should only be used in a small minority of submissions where a **critical improvement** must be made, to be assessed by the track chairs and you within a short timeframe (e.g., two weeks). Track chairs will not permit a large number of "conditional accept" ratings as our review process does not have capacity to re-review a large number of submissions.

### An example meta-review

Below is an example of a useful meta-review:

> This paper is on the usefulness of thematic analysis in instrument evaluation. The authors performed a thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews of six experimental musicians. Through this method, they found that there were new insights that are not captured by other methods such as surveys.
>
> This work has several strong points. For example, Reviewers 1 and 2 point out that this submission provides a solid primer on thematic analysis and how it can be applied to the evaluation of NIME work. Reviewer 1 adds that the method is rigorous, and the authors demonstrate their deep engagement with thematic analysis. I agree with these assessments.
>
> That said, the reviewers pointed out several drawbacks to this work. First of all, all reviewers mentioned that the authors do not engage with NIME work that has used this method before. \[Give examples.\] Reviewer 2 suggests that citing some of these works in the Background would communicate awareness of this work, and provide an opportunity for the authors to explain how this method is different. Secondly, Reviewers 1 and 2 add that while the authors claim that new insights are possible that go beyond what’s able to be captured by surveys, there is no comparison of methods in order to make a credible claim. Though I don’t think that this demonstration is strictly necessary in every case, unfortunately this is the main stated contribution of this paper, and I agree that this claim is not well supported.
>
> For this reason, my recommendation for this paper is Reject. This is because there is already ample work on using thematic analysis for instrument evaluation, and this submission does not go beyond that existing work, except with the claim of better insights which is unfortunately unsupported. I encourage the authors to read the insightful and important critiques submitted by the reviewers, and to re-submit this work in the future - there is a kernel of a good idea here, and with more support of the paper’s claims (or an alternative framing) this could be a very useful contribution.

### Fill in other fields and feedback.

There are other fields in the meta-review form that are optional:

**Please enter justification for your decision here (this will NOT be shared with the authors but only visible to the NIME chairs)** Meta reviewers should comment on their final decision to the track chairs. This can be simple as agreement with the reviewers or include other perspectives that should be considered in this decision.

**Are any changes required to the submission format? (e.g. length, formatting, ethics statement)** This field is to list minor formatting and content suggestions for authors. Information here should not be serious enough to merit a conditional acceptance but is just to help authors meet formatting and presentation quality standards at NIME or, if rejected, at another publication venue.

### Outline of the meta review questions and considerations

The meta review consists of 10 questions which address summarisation of the reviewers’ comments, own perspective, and recommendations for the paper in the conference. As a brief overview:

**1\. (Final Decision to be displayed to Authors) After careful deliberation by our volunteer reviewers and the Paper Chairs, your submission has been given the following status:**

- **Reject**
- **Accept**
- **Accept as different presentation format**
- **Conditional Accept**

Meta reviewers should select their decision **to be displayed to Authors** - this is done preliminarily at the point of meta review but may be reconsidered or discussed with the Paper Chairs in the case of any irreconcilable reviewer feedback.

**2\. (Final Meta Review to be displayed to Authors) Please enter a summary of the referees' reviews for the submission:**

Meta reviewers should provide a summary of the referees’ reviews here as a synopsis of the reviews, to be displayed to Authors.

**3\. (To be displayed to Authors) Please enter your review/meta-review here: \***

Meta reviewers should enter their meta review here, reflective of their overall position and including perspectives from the other referees.

Meta reviewers should indicate the decision for the paper - to reject, accept, accept in a different format, or a conditional accept\* - in the case of conditional accept, this must be justified in Q7

**4\. Please indicate a score for your review (your overall opinion, including perspectives from the other referees) \***

*   **Strong reject**
*   **Lean reject**
*   **Lean accept**
*   **Strong accept**
    
This is the rating for your review; not equivalent with a recommendation, as above in Q4, but your overall assessment of the paper. This question helps to justify Q4 from your perspective as meta reviewer; e.g., a paper may be _Q4 = Accept_ and _Q6 = Strong accept_ to highlight the quality, but may also be something like _Q4 = Accept as different presentation format_ and _Q6 = Strong accept._

**5\. Please enter justification for your decision here (this will NOT be shared with the authors but only visible to the NIME chairs) \***

Meta reviewers should comment on this decision to the NIME chairs - this can be simple as agreement with the reviewers or other perspectives that should be considered in this decision.

**6\. Use this box if you are recommending this paper as "Accept as different presentation format" or "Conditional Accept." Please state why this is the case, and what specifically what the authors must do before the camera ready deadline in the case of Conditional Accept. Papers with conditional accept will need a final confirmation before being accepted.**

This option should be used if you indicate Conditional Accept or Accept as different presentation format: If you are recommending a paper be conditionally accepted, you must highlight why this is the case (e.g., the paper has high value and rigour and you feel should be included, but it is missing a key consideration or clarification in order to be accepted/the paper fits into a different format. However, the consideration can be easily addressed within the camera ready timeline without additional research being done). This must be justified to Paper Chairs and papers with conditional accept will need a final confirmation before being confirmed accept.

**7\. (Optional, to be shared with Authors) Are any changes required to the paper format? (e.g. length, formatting, ethics statement)**

Meta reviewers should note cosmetic or formatting concerns, missing ethics statements, and length adjustments to make - this may apply to any paper category, but should be cases where the concern does not interfere with the overall quality of the paper (e.g., the paper is of good quality and rigour but references need to be cleaned up).

**8\. (Optional) Please enter any comments for the NIME chairs (this will NOT be shared with the authors)**

Anything else the Paper Chairs should consider - can be written confidentially to us.

## Review Frequently Asked Questions

### Is review anonymous?

The NIME review process for music and paper tracks is double-blind. This means that the authors don’t know who the reviewers are.

The workshop track is generally single-blind so reviewers can see authors identities but authors do not know who the reviewers are.

### What should I do if I recognise the work I’m being asked to review?

When you volunteer for reviewing you are asked to state your conflicts of interest, meaning people that you work closely with now, or those you’ve worked closely with in the past. This information is used to avoid direct conflicts of interest in reviewer allocation, but as we are a small field, we often know about research from our international friends without having worked or published with them leading to recognition of work during review.

If this happens, email the meta-reviewer or track chair. In some cases another reviewer may be required. In other cases, it may be that although you recognise a system or research theme, you do not actually know who the authors are (e.g., different students or team members are involved with a similar stream of research work over the years).

### What should I do if I feel completely unqualified to assess this submission?

Though we try to match the specialisation of reviewers to the submissions, you might get a review on a subject you don’t know very much about, or one using methods or coming from a research tradition you are not familiar with or comfortable evaluating.

Here good reviews are essential! A summary of the paper, what you understand from it as someone without expertise in this area, and what you see as strengths and weaknesses is very useful and provides important author feedback.

If you are really not comfortable reviewing it because doing so requires specific topical or methodological expertise, please contact your meta-reviewer or track chairs.

### How long should a review be?

Typically NIME reviews are 200-600 words, but reviews have a recommended structure: It should summarise the paper’s topic and main points, state the positive and negative aspects, and offer a recommendation for acceptance with a well-articulated reasoning for that recommendation. 

Very short reviews (less than 100 words) are generally not acceptable. Very long reviews (e.g., more than 1500 words), while often well-meaning, can be overwhelming to authors given. In both cases a meta-reviewer may ask reviewers to edit their review.

### If the paper is great, do I need to submit a detailed review?

Yes! Authors depend on feedback, and explaining why you thought something was great is as important as a less positive critique.

It's vitally important to justify **what** is great about a submission and **why** so that a meta-reviewer can use this information to justify acceptance.

Unfortunately, very short positive reviews can harm authors where they are outweighed in the process by exhaustive critiques. If you like a paper, please articulate exactly why it should be accepted. 

### What happens if the paper content is valuable, but the writing isn’t good?

We ask that reviewers focus on the _content_ of the paper. Meta-reviewers will make the call about whether the writing is a factor.

Please note: In recent years there has been an effort within NIME to offer peer proofreading, to include submissions from people whose English is not their first language but whose content makes important contributions. After review, meta-reviewers will decide whether the paper should undergo proofreading.

### What makes a paper unreviewable (desk rejected)?

Papers are removed from review at the beginning of the process (known as a “desk reject”) for the following reasons:

* The authors names are included (i.e., the paper is not anonymised)
* The paper is not submitted in English
* The paper is obviously not complete (i.e., section headings but no content)
* The paper has clear ethical issues (i.e., the study creates some clear danger for participant, or no previous ethical approval was obtained)
    
These are the only situations in which there can be a desk rejection. Otherwise, the paper goes to review. Decisions to remove a paper from the review process are serious and so must be agreed by two chairs (track or general) of the conference. 

On the positive side, early feedback can give authors a chance to solve critical issues and resubmit to another venue quickly.

### What happens if I don’t submit a review?

Since NIME is dependent on reviews to select the proceedings, we ask you to please, please submit your reviews if you have committed to reviewing for this year’s NIME.

If for some reason reviewing is impossible, please tell your meta-reviewer as soon as possible so another reviewer can  be found.

If you fail to submit reviews without explanation, you may not be invited to review in future.

### Can the results of the reviewing process be contested? 

Since NIME is a small conference with limited resources, we don’t offer a rebuttal phase for reviews. Once the reviews are released, the decisions are final.
