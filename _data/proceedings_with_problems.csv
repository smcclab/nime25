The system maps sound grains from oceanic field recordings to a navigable latent space using autoencoders and clustering techniques, controlled via hand gestures and touch. This interface physically connects performers with sonic representations of anthropogenic material transformations in coastal environments.",nime2025_8.pdf,,,8.jpg,,registration,
187,paper,oral,medium,,,10,in person,Designing Sensory NIME for Autism,Aditya Arora; Erica Tandori; James Marshall; Stuart Favilla,"This paper explores how sensory NIME design principles may inform the design of musical interfaces tailored for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), focusing on their sensory processing challenges. Given the prevalence of sensory over-responsivity (SOR) and under-responsivity (SUR) in ASD, traditional sensory interventions often fail to accommodate the highly individualized and fluctuating sensory needs of autistic individuals. The authors highlight the potential for multisensory NIME to address the diverse range of sensory needs, promoting emotional regulation and sensory balance through new creative musical opportunities and activities. This paper presents research in the form of a narrative review and comparative case study of recent NIME and sensory intervention research, exploring emerging approaches, rhythm-based interventions, generative algorithms, play-centered designs and other possibilities for enhancing sensory engagement and emotional regulation. Drawing on insights from 30 recent NIME papers, this research explores the boundaries of current approaches and seeks to establish an understanding of multisensory NIME for ASD. The research underscores the profound variability in sensory profiles for ASD, necessitating a shift from clinician-directed interventions to creative, inclusive, multisensory solutions. Finally, a set of sensory NIME design principles are offered, emphasizing the importance of sensory perception, sensory equilibrium and the promotion of emotional regulation for ASD.",nime2025_187.pdf,,,187.jpg,,registration,
141,music,Installation,,,,N/A*,Remote,"break me, genAI",Mayank Sanganeria; Kurt Werner,"This paper presents ""break me, generative ai,"" an audiovisual artwork exploring the intersection of human perception and artificial intelligence in music visualization. The work addresses limitations in current Music Information Retrieval (MIR) approaches by implementing a novel multilayered system that combines hand-drawn MIDI parameter curves, procedurally generated visuals inspired by synesthetic artists, and various AI transformation processes including StyleGAN, Stable Diffusion, and AnimateDiff. By preserving artistic intent throughout the generation process while leveraging AI capabilities, the system creates visuals that better reflect the complex, context-dependent nature of musical perception. The resulting artwork serves as both a technical demonstration and an artistic exploration of human-AI collaboration, challenging viewers to consider questions of authorship, perception, and the preservation of artistic intent in AI-processed creative works. This approach offers new possibilities for the creation of audiovisual art that bridge the gap between purely automated systems and traditional human-driven approaches.",nime2025_141.pdf,,,141.jpg,,cr,
199,music,Installation,,,,N/A*,In person,FlowState,Scott Smallwood; Marilene Oliver; Daniel Evans,"FlowState is a virtual reality (VR) installation inspired by one of several dozen ancient Celtic baths in the Brittany region of France, built by Bretons in the 3-5th centuries. These baths were believed to be places of healing, often of very specific ailments, and were part of a larger culture of water as a healing agent. In our piece, the visitor initially encounters a field of particles, a point cloud outlining the bath structure in an empty black space (see fig. 1). As the visitor explores the area, moving arms in swim-like strokes causes interaction with the soundscape, including the addition of water sounds, and eventually leading to the particles resolving into a more realistic conception of the space, via lidar scans, 360-degree video, and sound recorded on the actual site of the fountain.",nime2025_199.pdf,,,199.jpg,,cr,
89,music,Live Performance,,,,10,In person,Housework Commons: Textile Rhetorics II,Jocelyn Ho,"Housework Commons, a feminist activist project under the Women’s Labor initiative, transforms domestic tools into Embedded Acoustic Instruments (EAIs) using sensor technologies. It reimagines unpaid, undervalued domestic labor—traditionally private—as a shared act of activism, addressing global gender inequality in domestic work through public engagement with gendered objects.
Housework Commons includes two custom instruments:
1.	Embedded Iron v.3, based on an early-20th-century ironing board and iron, uses machine learning and sensors to alter pitch based on the iron’s position and sound quality (timbre) depending on fabric color and texture. The board acts as a resonator with a transducer and speaker.
2.	Rheostat Rotary Rack, inspired by a rotary dryer, features rheostats, a rotary encoder, and an 8-speaker base. Hanging clothing triggers pitches based on weight, while rotating the rack by hand or wind adds select frequencies.

The performance of new composition, Textile Rhetorics II for two performers, will feature Embedded Iron and Rheostat Rotary Rack with other objects from the domestic sphere. Central to Textile Rhetorics are woven textile scores and fabric banners that contain living testimonies from women. These testimonies were collected during a past workshop with a mothers’ group, and additional banners will be created during the proposed NIME workshop (separate application). These create a “living archive” installation, a dynamic site where the performance unfolds.

It is played using two electromagnetic pickup coils, which are used to listen to a cloud of electromagnetic fields produced by the instrument. The fields are laid out in an isomorphic pattern and identified by small dots on the instrument’s surface. Making use of the Chromaplane  and other electronic devices, this 10 minute long musical performance highlights the instrument’s capabilities in a performance context.",nime2025_130.pdf,,,130.jpg,,registration,
158,music,Installation,,,,N/A*,In person,Bending Nature: An Architectural Sound Installation Exploring the Resonance of Architectural Texture and Natural Sound,Han Xu; Zehao Wang,"Bending Nature is an architectural sound installation situated in a confined, irregular space. By repurposing part of the raw speakers as microphones and surface transducers placed directly on the walls activate the architectural texture, the work merges natural sounds with feedback loops and creates a resonant dialogue between the building and its environment. Through a visually minimalist presentation, viewers are immersed in a dynamic, ever-changing soundscape that challenges spatial perception and offers a novel sensory experience of sound and structure.",nime2025_158.pdf,,,158.jpg,,registration,
182,music,Live Performance,,,,20,In person,"My sunset is your sunrise, yet we touch",Dirk Stromberg; Jocelyn  Ho; MIchal Seta,"In “My sunset is your sunrise, yet we touch,” we propose a three-way hybrid-telematic improvisation, by three displaced musicians, featuring 2 DMIs, and an acoustic-prepared piano. The musicians are located in Montreal, Singapore and Canberra at the NIME conference. This performance explores the concept of a multimedia meta-instrument, a collaborative process that integrates audio, video, projection, and lighting into a cohesive whole. The meta-instrument redefines presence and interaction, challenging traditional notions tied to physical co-location. Our approach draws on Karen Barad’s concept of touch as an entangled, relational act. Here, touch extends beyond the physical to encompass the mediated interplay of sound, visuals, gestures, and light across networked spaces. In this environment, the tactility of capacitive keys, the resonances of the prepared piano, and the shifting gestural logic of controller-based sound art merge into a dynamic, co-constitutive system. This telematic improvisation demonstrates how the tactile interactions with instruments, the resonances of sound, and the dynamic interplay of light and video create new forms of connectivity and shared expression across a blurring of physical and virtual spaces. Through this meta-instrument, we aim to push the boundaries of telematic collaboration and artistic interaction.

307,music,Live Performance,,,,7,In person,Gaia is hanging by a thread...,Taurin Barrera,"Gaia is hanging by a thread... is an interactive audiovisual performance that explores the delicate balance between technology, humanity, and our planet’s ecosystem. This approximately 6-minute performance aligns primarily with solarpunk aesthetics, offering a critical contemplation of electronic art, sustainability, and collective eco-consciousness through audience interaction and connection.

At the heart of this performance is the Solar Punk Console, a solar-powered capacitive synthesizer that embodies the solarpunk ethos of sustainable technology and community interconnectedness. This synthesizer not only harnesses solar energy but also invites audience participation, as conductive threads connected to the Solar Punk Console’s synthesis control inputs are deployed into the audience during performance. Participants are encouraged to hold, manipulate, or pass these threads, forming a complex electronic circuit within the performance venue. This interaction directly impacts both the audio output and the visual atmosphere of the performance space using audiovisual processing software created in Max. This piece utilizes feedback in both audio and visual systems to blur the lines between performer, audience, and environment, as collective actions of the audience shape a interwoven synesthetic sensory experience in real-time.",nime2025_307.pdf,,,307.jpg,,registration,
7,music,Live Performance,,,,6,In person,Live Microtonal Performance,Amanda Cole,"I will compose and perform a new microtonal work for Lumatone keyboard, iPad ensemble and tuned metallic bars (Tubophone) made by a Canberra based percussionist. I will play the Lumatone MIDI keyboard part using my own Lumatone (isomorphic microtonal keyboard with coloured hexagonal keys). The Lumatone will use an original mapping of a 48 note to the octave 7-limit just intonation scale. The iPad ensemble will be 'Touchscreen Ensemble', which is an ANU students ensemble coordinated by Charles Martin.  This ensemble piece will explore harmonies, melodies and textures in just intonation tuning played on new interfaces for musical expression.",nime2025_7.pdf,,,7.jpg,,"registration, cr",
51,music,Remote Performance,,,,8,Remote,CONJURE-II,Huichun Yang,"CONJURE-II explores the dynamic intra-action between body, sound, and materiality through the use of a balloon as an apparatus. The tension and pressure between the performer's body and the balloon push the boundaries of ""skin,"" suggesting that these boundaries are not fixed but rather determined by the vibrations that resonate within and between all entities. The balloon becomes a site where vibrations mediate the boundaries of self and world, creating an ephemeral interplay of effort, vulnerability, and transformation. The system uses sound captured from the balloon surface, the performer's breathing, and modular synthesis, spatialized through ambisonics to create an evolving sonic environment.",nime2025_51.pdf,,,51.jpg,,"registration, cr",
249,music,Live Performance,,,,6,In person,Harmonic Turbulences,Gaël Moriceau,"This piece explores sound synthesis and instrumental interaction using the T-Stick, a well-established gestural controller. Paired with a frequency modulation (FM) synthesis engine in SuperCollider, the T-Stick functions as a digital musical instrument (DMI), enabling the performer to shape sounds in real-time. The FM technique of timbral synthesis was chosen due to the simplicity of its algorithm for generating complex spectra. This composition is part of a research project aimed at expanding the T-Stick repertoire and developing new playing techniques for DMIs.",nime2025_249.pdf,,,249.jpg,,"registration, cr",
293,music,Live Performance,,,,15,In person,"Improvising with ""GravField"": A Participatory Performance Exploring How Digital Objects Mediate Intercorporeal Movements within Collocated Mixed Reality",Botao Hu; Yuemin Huang; Mingze Chai; Xiaobo Hu; Yilan Tao; Rem RunGu Lin," As mixed reality technologies evolve, they blur the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds, prompting a reevaluation of how we engage with digital objects and mediated environments. This paper investigates the emerging concept of ""digital physics"" in MR, where digital objects, as informational entities, shape both cognitive and somatic experiences. Building on the ""somatic turn"" in human-computer interaction, we explore how the human body, as a site of interaction, adapts to new forms of embodied collaboration in MR spaces. Through the lens of contact improvisation, we introduce GravField, a live performance-based MR system that uses Audio-Visual Virtual Mediators (AVVMs) to facilitate interdependent behaviors among participants. These AVVMs incorporate metaphors such as springs, ropes, and magnetic fields, shaping bodily movement and social dynamics through dynamic, sensory feedback. Drawing from post-phenomenological theories, this research examines the relationships between embodiment, interpretation, alterity, and background in the context of MR. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how digital objects mediate embodied interaction and collective behavior, offering practical insights for designing entangled and embodied experiences in MR environments.",nime2025_293.pdf,,,293.jpg,,"registration, cr",

The workshop integrates community-engaged participant action research approaches of Story Circle Method and Photovoice Method with EAI interactive engagement, where participants engage in a co-led, interdisciplinary  workshop to dialogue about issues of gender inequality in the NIME community and write down their experiences on fabric banners. These fabric banners, together with fabric banners from a past workshop with a local mothers’ will be featured in interactive installation that sonifies housework gestures. These fabric banners that encapsulate today’s experiences of gender inequality create a “living archive” installation, a dynamic site where installation and performance unfolds.

334,workshop,,,workshops-2,,,,"Global Entanglements, Music and the Commodification of Cultural Labour in the Age of AI",Tom Willma; Oliver Bown,"Motivated by global discussions of socio-technical change and recent Australian legislative lobbying, this short-form, 3-hour workshop targets the commodification of cultural labour and current entanglements between social, political, corporate and technological actors in the music industry. The objective of this workshop is to hold a critically minded discussion between guest panellists from the Australian music sector and NIME colleagues, grappling with these sociotechnical imperatives both generally, across the industry, and particularly, within the context of live performance. Key takeaways of this workshop include:

• An empirical overview that survey’s sociotechnical change and AI use across global music industries
• A critical discussion that scopes key political-economic concerns in the music sector
• Proposed frames for NIME research community to engage with industry and develop key strategies for ethical AI adoption
• Directions for future discourses, policy considerations and further dialogues of sociotechnical transformation in the music industry

Discussions between panellists and attendees will be guided by three critical questions:
1) What political-economic changes have been taking place in global music cultures, including but not limited to those involving AI and live virtualisation technologies?
2) How does the NIME research community interface with music cultures beyond academia in an age of AI, particularly in the development of live music technologies?
3) What blind sports are being neglected by the current trajectory of political and industrial discourses? How is our work being affected, what voices are being heard above others and what could/should be done?

Please note that the content of this workshop will be recorded and may be developed and referenced in future research and publications by the organisers, as may a record of workshop minutes be published.",nime2025_334.pdf,,,334.jpg,,registration,Hanna Neumann 1.37
338,workshop,,,workshops-1,,,,MoNoDeC: The Mobile Node Controller Platform,Nick Hwang; Anthony Marasco,"MoNoDeC is a multichannel audio system that uses audience mobile phones and IoT-hardware-driven speakers as point sources for configurable and dynamic immersive audio speakers and audience performance interfaces. Audience participants register their current location within a customizable audience space diagram on their mobile phones. Their phones then become a point source speaker within the immersive experience. A person designated as the performance/installation ‘controller’ sends audio, control, and interface data to participants throughout the experience. In addition to diffusing audio to mobile devices, MoNoDeC can include embedded computer instruments known as ‘autonomous hubs’: IoT-based speakers that receive playback/diffusion data. These autonomous hubs are meant to be used in larger sound diffusion performance settings as well as installation/fixed point source scenarios in conjunction with audience-provided devices. 

This workshop will lead participants on setting up the MoNoDeC system, designing registration and location-choosing presets for audience members to engage with, and methods for panning audio around the networked mobile device speaker array during a live composition. Participants will also learn the basics of Collab-Hub, our framework for sharing control data between networked telematic performers that serves as the backbone of MoNoDeC. After learning the core features of both systems, participants will form groups and design short immersive compositions using the framework. participants will set up the MoNoDec system, design registration and location-choosing presets for audience members to engage with, and explore methods for panning audio around the networked mobile device speaker array during a live composition. At the end of the session, participants will form groups and design short immersive compositions using the system. ",nime2025_338.pdf,,,338.jpg,,registration,Hanna Neumann 3.41
