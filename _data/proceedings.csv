10,paper,oral,long,papers-4,"Environment, Sustainability, Longevity",1,15,in person,Looping slowly: Diffraction through the lens of nostalgia,Benedict Gaster; Nathan Renney; Jasmine Butt,"This paper concerns magnetic tape and the nostalgia of media, finding new relevance in old technology, remaking and adapting practices to fit within a modern workflow. Pushing against the driving force of economic structures, which emphasises a continuous cycle of replacement, musicians and instrument designers are drawing on a shared history to create new pieces of art and machines. This can be read as reflecting NIME's Code of Practice and, more generally, the unfolding climate crisis. For some, NIME may convey a focus on new musical instruments, but here, we focus on the notion of new through the diffracted lens of the old. Defined in recent NIME conferences by zooming in on the 'O' in NIME through the importance of reusing and repurposing old musical instruments and, in our case, old practices and processes. This paper considers magnetic tape and the machines that process it as the material and instrument. Following a survey, we present a diffracted reading through an intra-related process of how musicians, producers, and others who work with audio integrate tape into their practice. Drawing on post-humanist theories, we explore how slowness, community, and the old can inform NIME as a methodology. It provides insight for NIME to continue moving forward while focusing, through its Code of Practice, on sustainability, connection with our past, our history, years of artistic practice, and workflows that are not simply optimised for efficiency or the new.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_2.pdf,,,10.jpg,,,

The system is based on a biologically-inspired architecture that traces the sound pathway from the cochlea to the auditory cortex. The system transforms acoustic features into neural representations by integrating Meddis's Inner Hair-Cell (IHC) model with spiking neural networks (SNN). The mapping process occurs in three phases: the IHC model converts sound waves into neural impulses, simulating hair cell mechano-electrical transduction. These impulses are then encoded into spatio-temporal patterns through an Izhikevich-based neural network, where spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms enable the emergence of activation structures reflecting the acoustic information's complexity. Finally, these patterns are mapped into both EEG-like signals and continuous control maps for real-time interactive performance control. This approach bridges neural dynamics and signal processing, offering a new paradigm for sound information representation. The generated control maps provide a natural interface between acoustic and parametric domains, enabling applications from generative sound design to adaptive performance control, where neuromorphological sound translation explores new forms of audio-driven interaction.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_3.pdf,,,11.jpg,,,

19,paper,poster,long,posters-1,,,5,remote,A Study to Discover Metrics to Measure Kinesthetic Empathy During Interactive Music Performance,Ryan Ingebritsen; Daniel Evans; Christopher Knowlton,"Kinesthetic empathy is a term used in performance and kinesthetic interaction, defined as the ability of participants to “read, decode and react to each other’s input”.  In prior studies, performers of interactive music self-reported sensing the presence of other musicians. The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify kinesthetic empathy between two individuals in a live electronic performance reported as perceived interactivity. Participants viewed eight videos, both real duets, and spliced solos appearing as real duets, rating each video. The questions guiding this study were: (a) is there a difference in perceived interactivity between the live and spliced duets, (b) is there a relationship between performance rating and perceived interactivity. Results showed a significant difference in the perceived interactivity of the video conditions. Further, the results showed a significant relationship between performance rating and perceived interactivity of the performers. The results suggest that perceived interactivity between performers could be a metric to measure kinesthetic empathy between performers facilitated by an interactive performance system that could be used to objectively measure the effectiveness of design and pedagogical interventions for new interfaces for musical expression.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_5.pdf,,,19.jpg,,,

This virtual keyboard is highly customizable: users can freely program the number of keys and their respective pitches. Modern software instruments offer advanced capabilities, including microtonal scales (pitches outside the standard 12-tone equal temperament). However, playing these instruments often remains challenging due to the lack of corresponding physical hardware. Our proposed solution addresses this gap by projecting a programmable virtual keyboard onto a tangible object within the XR space. This approach combines the software's flexibility with the tactile feedback of a physical surface, enhancing playability. Users can simplify the keyboard layout (e.g., fewer keys than a piano) or expand it beyond conventional limits to explore new expressive possibilities, particularly for microtonal music. We conducted a small pilot study (N=4) involving participants mostly inexperienced with keyboards to gather preliminary feedback on the interface's ease of use for performance.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_6.pdf,,,20.jpg,,,

The design of the pattern organ, inspired by experimental optical sound-on-film practices, employs a method of visual-to-audio synthesis that responds closely to the material behaviours captured by its camera input. Drawing on findings from exploratory workshops and short material experiments, we describe how interactions emerge and are shaped by both the physical configuration of the instrument and the material behaviours captured by its camera. We consider how frugal mappings and the ‘rawness’ of data can give rise to instruments whose inputs remain open to material complexity, extending the sound engine beyond their enclosures. In the case of the pattern organ, this complexity emerges through overlapping and interfering interactions, where structural forms, human influence, light, shadows, lens distortions, and system quirks all contribute to the shifting harmonic content of the wavetable. We reflect on the instrument as a fluid assemblage, composed of human and non-human entanglements, encouraging us to think beyond traditional notions of human-centred control.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_7.pdf,,,21.jpg,,,

30,music,Live Performance,,concert-5,,2,7,In person,MSN/AV (Maximum Silence to Noise/Audio-Visual),John Ferguson; Andrew Brown,"MSN/AV (Maximum Silence to Noise/Audio-Visual) is an interactive audiovisual system performed by two musicians. The sound world is created through ring modulation synthesis controlled by multi-dimensional touch gestures. This approach provides a rich diversity of sonic potential whilst maintaining clear remnants of physical gestures. Each musician uses a ROLI Lightpad Block and an iPad running TouchOSC to control bespoke software written in Pure data. Interaction data from each performer is passed to a Touch Designer network which generates and/or manipulates visual materials. MSN/AV celebrates physical interplay with gestural interfaces and situates live improvisation within a responsive audiovisual environment. Sensor data is used to generate sound and graphics in real-time, aiming for an audiovisual entanglement that provides sonic and visual connections ranging from the gentle steering of musical improvisation to more autonomous and potentially disruptive behaviour. At the heart of MSN/AV is a novel implementation of ring modulation that features two identical oscillators. These oscillators morph from silence to white noise, passing through sine and square waveforms along the way. This morphing capability enables a smooth transition from simple to complex audio spectra.

MSN Synthesis
The term ‘maximum silence’ refers to the absence of sound in a ring modulator when either modulating oscillator is silent. To maintain modulation independent of the amplitude envelope, a DC offset ‘silence’ signal is introduced, ensuring consistent gain as the modulating oscillator's amplitude decreases. A ROLI Block serves as the primary gestural controller for MSN/AV. Its touchpad maps silence-to-noise transitions on the x-axis and oscillator pitch on the y-axis, while pressure controls the amplitude envelope. Two oscillators, each controlled by a finger on the multi-touch pad, are ring modulated, offering six dimensions of control for expressive sound shaping. An iPad running TouchOSC provides on-screen sliders and buttons to control audio effects and, when applicable, visual parameters. These include volume, panning automation, delay, and reverb.

Research Question(s) 
The goal is to explore gestural control of sound and vision while creating new artistic work that engages with rich audio spectra and the entanglement within audiovisual practices. This expressiveness in gesturally controlled ring modulation synthesis builds on a history of ‘noisy’ interactive electronic instruments like the Crackle Box , BoardWeevil, and Atari Punk Console, which use ring modulation or similar techniques to produce dynamic inharmonic spectra. While ‘live visuals’ are now common in contemporary performance, the role of the musical score is evolving. Yet, aside from a few notable exceptions (Louise Harris, Myriam Bleau, Vicki Bennett, Nonotak Studio), there is little artistic research on improvising musicians in responsive audiovisual environments—an area MSN/AV seeks to explore.
- Our primary research questions are: 
- To what extent can improvised performance with interactive technology be successfully situated in a responsive audio-visual environment? 
- What creative opportunities emerge when ‘musical improvisation and ‘live visuals’ combine in an environment where the line between cause and effect is blurred? 

Audiovisual Context
A useful starting point is visual music: Oskar Fischinger’s (1938) An Optical Poem is an early example that William Moritz (1986) has used to suggest that ‘[s]ince ancient times, artists have longed to create with moving lights a music for the eye comparable to the effects of sound for the ear.’ [4] However, many early exemplars work with fixed musical and visual resources, whereas MSN/AV focuses on improvised live performance in interactive environments. The real genesis might therefore be a work like John Cage’s Variations V (1965), which was created in collaboration with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and made use of shadows cast on walls to trigger sound via light sensors. This resonates with what Simon Waters (2013) has termed ‘Touching at a Distance’ [5] and might also be considered via John Whitney’s (1994) notion of ‘audio-visual complementarity’. [6] These are all useful historical ideas that have helped develop this project. More recently, Cat Hope and Lindsay Vickery (2010) have furthered discussion of ‘The Aesthetics of the Screen-Score’ [3] and it is clear their Decibel ensemble is a leader in this field. Similarly, Louise Harris (2021) has examined the nature of audio-visual experience [2] with a particular emphasis on media hierarchy; our work builds upon her 2016 article ‘Audiovisual Coherence and Physical Presence’ [1], which emphasises the relationship between audio-visual media and physical (human) presence.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_30.pdf,,,30.jpg,,,

Usually, sensors are connected to physical computing platforms, and solutions to transmit data to the computer often rely on low-bandwidth communicating channels. It is not obvious how to interface physical computing platforms with data science environments, which also operate under distinct constraints and programming styles.

As a redesign of the well-known RAVE model, BRAVE introduces a series of architectural modifications for supporting instrumental interaction with almost imperceptible latency (<10 ms) and jitter (~ 3 ms). By comparing both designs, we highlight key architectural differences between the models that impact their instrumental performance capability, arguing that no model fits all purposes, and calling for their careful selection for each interactive design. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging low-latency waveform autoencoders to develop interactive systems, such as Digital Musical Instruments, that can foster control intimacy through enhanced responsiveness and space for nuance.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_10.pdf,,,33.jpg,,,

Reflection on a three-month period of iteration and refinement highlights a series of design issues, but also the interconnectedness of physical impairments, and the difficulties of designing for a body in flux. Some directions for future work are outlined.

43,music,Remote Performance,,concert-2,,4,5,Remote,State Change: Merging Adaptive Music Technology with Disability Aesthetics,Molly Joyce,"State Change is a forthcoming album that transforms surgical records into musical lyrics and uses aural material generated by accelerometers and motion capture systems. By intertwining the medical and the aural, the album offers a sonic exploration of acquired disability, transforming personal and embodied experiences into a musical language. My interest in disability is rooted in my own lived experience. At the age of seven, I was involved in a car accident that nearly resulted in the amputation of my left hand. This life-altering event set me on a journey of adapting my relationship with music, leading me to experiment with different instruments and, more recently, to explore music technologies that align with my physical capabilities. These include accelerometers and motion capture devices, which have become central to my creative process. The featured track from the album, August 6, 1999, utilizes the MUGIC (Music/User Gesture Interface Control) device, an innovative motion sensor developed by violinist and composer Mari Kimura. The MUGIC translates hand movements into software parameters: “rotation” (pronation and supination) triggers high-frequency sine tones, while “yaw” (vertical axis rotation) triggers low-frequency sine tones. This track integrates lyrical text drawn from the surgical records of my first post-accident operation, alongside layered vocal elements that convey the emotional weight of that experience. Together, these elements create a deeply personal and evocative sonic representation of my journey with disability.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_43.pdf,,,43.jpg,,,
44,paper,poster,medium,posters-1,,,5,remote,Out-of-Control Feedback Systems and Collaborative Influence with the Instrumentalist Mixer Feedback Transmutation System,Nolan Hildebrand; Timothy Roth,"This paper explores the Instrumentalist Mixer Feedback Transmutation (IMFT) system, a modification of the typical no-input mixer paradigm meant for collaborative improvisatory performance (formally called NIMB+)[9]. IMFT occurs when an instrumentalist is patched into a mixing board with feedback loops (a.k.a no-input mixer). The instrumentalist interacts and influences the mixer’s feedback together with another performer operating the mixer. Introducing an instrument into the no-input mixer’s previously closed system creates possibilities for new collaborative interactions between humans and chaotic feedback systems. In this system, a chaotic, out-of-control relationship can be formed where the output of the mixer and the gestures from the mixer performer can be in battle with the input from the instrumentalist and vice-versa. After a brief historical contextualization of mixer feedback, the IMFT system and the complex relationships that form between human and machine are introduced. No-input mixer performance practices are discussed, followed by exploration of a single feedback loop to illustrate some of the mixer’s possible sound worlds and the nature of the instrument. Performance experiences from two recent compositions by the first author, generative open graphic score #1 (2023) and noise ritual (2023), are described in order to explore different performance interactions created by different instrumentalists working with the IMFT system. This practice-based research provides a useful case study examining the entangled relationship between performers and interfaces in feedback-based music systems and how innovative approaches to an established electronic practice can create new perspectives and collaborative opportunities.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_13.pdf,,,44.jpg,,,
49,paper,poster,long,posters-1,,,5,in person,Introducing EG-IPT and ipt~: a novel electric guitar dataset and a new Max/MSP object for real-time classification of instrumental playing techniques,Marco Fiorini; Nicolas Brochec; Joakim Borg; Riccardo Pasini,"This paper presents two key contributions to the real-time classification of Instrumental Playing Techniques (IPTs) in the context of NIME and human-machine interactive systems: the EG-IPT dataset and the ipt~ Max/MSP object. The EG-IPT dataset, specifically designed for electric guitar, encompasses a broad range of IPTs captured across six distinct audio sources (five microphones and one direct input) and three pickup configurations. This diversity in recording conditions provides a robust foundation for training accurate models. We evaluate the dataset by employing a Convolutional Neural Network-based classifier (CNN), achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide array of IPT classes, thereby validating the dataset’s efficacy. The ipt~ object is a new Max/MSP external enabling real-time classification of IPTs via pre-trained CNN models. While in this paper it's demonstrated with the EG-IPT dataset, the ipt~ object is adaptable to models trained on various instruments. By integrating EG-IPT and ipt~, we introduce a novel, end-to-end workflow that spans from data collection, model training to real-time classification and human-computer interaction. This workflow exemplifies the entanglement of diverse components (data acquisition, machine learning, real-time processing, and interactive control) within a unified system, advancing the potential for dynamic, real-time music performance and human-computer interaction in the context of NIME.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_14.pdf,,,49.jpg,,,

Throughout the curation of this project, each creative act has enabled us to contextualise, examine and reflect upon the design of this augmented instrument. In accordance with Stolterman and Wiberg’s concept driven design methodology, we do not present a singular instrument design, but instead an overarching design concept alongside its developmental and evaluative narrative. This augmentation centres upon the use of a drum trigger and a tactile transducer, which when coupled together can be used to feedback or resonate a drum. The resultant soundworld develops upon the idiomatic sonority of a drum, and allows for the duration and timbre of a drum strike to be continuously manipulated and shaped throughout a performance. In exploring the soundworld which results from this approach, we have experimented with numerous configurations of these pieces of hardware, and have also employed various pieces of software to parametrise the sonic subtleties that this approach engenders. Most prominently, we have developed a bespoke piece of software which analyses the modes of a drum prior to performance, and uses this modal analysis to shape the overall feedback and resonance. Throughout this design process, we have consistently been met with new creative criteria that challenge our approach and ideas, in response to the particularities of the musicians we are working alongside, as well as the performative and aesthetic environments we are working within.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_15.pdf,,,50.jpg,,,
52,music,Installation,,"installations-1, installations-2",,,,In person,Traceless,Xuedan Gao; Xinchen Liu,"The Anthropocene, a time defined by human impact since the 1950s, has led to significant environmental changes, often tied to the Earth's declining health. Glacial ice, formed over centuries through the compression of snow into dense, airless layers, symbolizes the vast, slow forces of nature. However, this balance has been disrupted in the past two centuries. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, urbanization, and industrialization have accelerated glacier melting, contributing to global warming and altering Earth's ecosystems. The contrast between glaciers' slow formation and rapid retreat shows the profound impact of human activities on natural processes.

Traceless is an interactive sound installation with visual projections that invites participants to use handheld controllers for audio and tactile interaction. Ice, a symbol of power in deep time and fragility in the Anthropocene, serves as both medium and collaborator in this work. Traceless includes the installation’s core structure, an interactive audio system, and visual projections. It captures the sounds of ice melting and dripping using contact microphones. The visual projections compare two timescales: the slow, natural progression of glacial formation and the rapid, human-accelerated retreat occurring today. We created animations of various forms of snowflakes combined with the rhythmic sound of dripping water to metaphorically represent the time spectrum of the various stages of glacier formation. To illustrate the impact of human activity on glacier melting, we utilized AI-driven videos generated through Stable Diffusion, along with the Greenland Surface Melt Extent dataset from the NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center). The two visual effects were switched through tactile interactions, bringing different times into the same space.

The interaction emphasizes the harmony between human actions and natural processes. When participants hold the controller, the corresponding musical note will play. When participants speak to the installation, their voices blend with the natural sounds of melting ice, which forms an echo that embraces change as part of the natural system. Human language is not parsed semantically and becomes increasingly blurred in the echo. This is a call-and-response process, where the ice and the system actively respond to the participants in their own rhythm that is not influenced by the participants, forming a mutual dialogue. The sounds metaphorically embed the vibrational frequencies of carbon-based life into the ancient resonance systems of geological formations. The sounds across material dimensions constitute dialogues between geological time and the Anthropocene. 

Traceless allows participants to experience and reflect on the agency of nature within a restricted dialogic framework. The asymmetric interaction exposes the boundaries of human intervention and guides participants to realize, through attempted 'collaboration' with the installation, that symbiosis resides not in technological domination, but in what Donna Haraway calls 'becoming with', an ongoing process of co-creation rather than control. By immersing participants in the multisensory experience, Traceless encourages them to think about the active role of nonhuman entities and to imagine a de-anthropocentric future.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_52.pdf,,,52.jpg,,,

Motivated to explore group-based live performance within VR, SVOrk has designed and crafted virtual musical interfaces, fantastical 3D-modeled environments, and a network infrastructure to support real-time shared participation. Inherent within this initiative is a reimagining of conventional concert experiences, introducing virtual lobbies, customizable avatars, and immersive audience interactions. These experimental features explore new forms of social presence, audience identities, and expressive communication to help address the overarching question, “What does it mean to participate in a VR musical performance?” SVOrk’s premiere concert took place in June 2024 with five performers and approximately 60 audience members (across five sessions), featuring a program of six musical works. This paper describes the motivations behind SVOrk, its research and development process—including designs for networking, avatar, and audience interaction—and takeaways from the premiere concert.

Recognising the barriers posed by traditional digital musical instruments, including steep learning curves, high costs, and uninspiring outputs, Harmonix prioritises affordability, portability, and user-friendly interfaces to cater to individuals with no prior musical training. The study evaluates two instruments, ZenithChimes and Equilibrio. ZenithChimes employs touch-sensitive keys mapped to meditative tones in the Aeolian mode, promoting creativity and relaxation. Equilibrio, a 3D-printed ""stone stack,"" uses tilt gestures to modulate soundscapes, symbolising balance and harmony. Both instruments integrate calming auditory outputs and minimalist design aesthetics to create an engaging and meditative experience. A workshop-based study with 10 participants, spanning diverse backgrounds, demonstrated the instruments' accessibility and therapeutic potential. Results showed that participants found the instruments easy to use, aesthetically appealing, and suitable for mindfulness practices, with 70 percent identifying their integration into meditation or yoga sessions as beneficial. However, feedback highlighted the need for more customisation options, particularly in Equilibrio's soundscapes. By bridging art, technology, and mindfulness, Harmonix fosters creative exploration and emotional regulation, with implications for therapeutic, educational, and artistic applications. Future work will explore sustainability, inclusivity, and multi-sensory feedback to enhance the instruments’ design and impact. This study underscores the potential of ADMIs to transcend conventional music-making, offering innovative tools for well-being and self-expression.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_22.pdf,,,66.jpg,,,

However in existing instruments, the fixed coupling between the virtual and physical environments constrains the affordances brought by Mixed Reality, such as per-musician free navigation in or multi-scale control of virtual structures. We designed gRAinyCloud, as a way to reintegrate these lost affordances to a co-located instrument. It allows for the expressive exploration of a set of sounds represented by a virtual structure of shapes placed in the physical space and shared between musicians. Above all, gRAinyCloud enables each musician to freely manipulate their own viewpoint, changing its scale, position and rotation, effectively decoupling the physical and virtual spaces, and to switch between self, other's and absolute viewpoint while playing.

Compared with the latter two, timbre is neither easy to define nor discretise when negotiating audio representations and gesture-sound mappings. We conduct a corpus assisted discourse analysis of ``timbre'' in all NIME proceedings to date (2001--2024). Combining this with a detailed review of 18 timbre-focused papers at NIME, we examine how definitions of timbre and timbre interaction methods are constructed through, for instance, Wessel's numerical timbre control space, synthesis tools and programming languages, machine learning and AI approaches, and other trends in digital lutherie practices. While acknowledging the practical utility of technical constructions of timbre in NIME (and other digital music research communities), we contribute discussion on the entanglement of technology and aesthetics in instrument design, which constitutes what ``timbre'' becomes in NIME research and reflect on the tension between technoscientific and constructivist understandings of timbre: how DMIs and musical practices have been reconstituted around particular timbral values operationalised in NIME. In response, we propose ways that the NIME community can embrace more critical approaches and awareness to how our methods and tools shape and co-create our notions of timbre, as well as other musical concepts, connecting more openly with diverse types of sonic phenomena.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_29.pdf,,,75.jpg,,,

These instruments enliven neurodiverse sensemaking in participatory design and STEAM learning. Through a multiyear research-practice partnership (RPP), we collaborated with teaching fellows to co-design a curriculum for neurodiverse middle school students that activates computational thinking (CT). This collaboration led to a web-based, quasi-modular interface connected to wearable music sensors. We situate our work within the growing literature on participatory design of collaborative accessible digital musical instruments (CADMIs). We describe how our co-design methods address the complex demands of ecosystemic thinking, sensitive to the varied entanglements that complicate traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) design and evaluation methods. Our pedagogical and methodological approach diverges from deficit-focused strategies that aim to develop neurotypical communication skills in neurodivergent individuals. Instead, we promote cross-neurotype collaboration without presuming a single mode of ""correct"" communication. Furthermore, we surface the potential of CADMIs by linking this notion to a pluralization of agency that extends beyond one-to-one body-sensor relationships. We develop accessible instruments within neurodiversity and autism contexts, avoiding reification of mindbody relations and recognizing them as dynamic, field-like, and embedded in facilitative relations for these communities.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_30.pdf,,,78.jpg,,,

It reimagines unpaid, undervalued domestic labor—traditionally private—as a shared act of activism, addressing global gender inequality in domestic work through public engagement with gendered objects.
Housework Commons includes two custom instruments:
1.	Embedded Iron v.3, based on an early-20th-century ironing board and iron, uses machine learning and sensors to alter pitch based on the iron’s position and sound quality (timbre) depending on fabric color and texture. The board acts as a resonator with a transducer and speaker.
2.	Rheostat Rotary Rack, inspired by a rotary dryer, features rheostats, a rotary encoder, and an 8-speaker base. Hanging clothing triggers pitches based on weight, while rotating the rack by hand or wind adds select frequencies.

The performance of new composition, Textile Rhetorics II for two performers, will feature Embedded Iron and Rheostat Rotary Rack with other objects from the domestic sphere. Central to Textile Rhetorics are woven textile scores and fabric banners that contain living testimonies from women. These testimonies were collected during a past workshop with a mothers’ group, and additional banners will be created during the proposed NIME workshop (separate application). These create a “living archive” installation, a dynamic site where the performance unfolds.

95,music,Remote Performance,,concert-5,,1,12,Remote,The Walkable Instrument: Modular Patches as Entangled Environments in OpenSoundLab,Ludwig Zeller; Anselm Bauer,"What happens if a modular synthesizer patch is no longer constrained to a flat, rigid configuration, but can instead be copied infinitely (and at no expense) and arranged in midair all around the performer? The performance showcases two modular patch designs assembled in OpenSoundLab, a mixed-reality patching system for Meta Quest that was developed in previous research. This platform allows users to freely position basic sound modules (oscillators, samplers, sequencers, effects, etc.) throughout real-world environments. 

A long-standing challenge in electronic-music performance—whether you’re working with hardware synths, modular rigs, software patches, or full DAW setups—is that the patch architecture and live tweaks remain opaque, even to expert listeners. The system is often too small, too cluttered by patch cables, or simply too complex and hidden in menus, sub-patches, or binary code to be grasped visually. When a musician plays a traditional keyboard or a self-built NIME-style instrument, the audience can readily perceive timing, effort, and skill. In classic synth-tweaking shows, however, such clear audiovisual cues are largely absent. OpenSoundLab resolves this by letting performers position a modular patch at any scale and in any arrangement within the stage space. Freed from rigging and gravity, a modular setup can expose its inner sonic architecture in three dimensions, with less-critical modulation oscillators tucked behind larger, more prominent elements. Multichannel components become visibly entangled around the performers, spreading out in front of—or even encircling—them to map the patch’s full sonic possibility space.

During the performance, Anselm Bauer will present two patches that illustrate this concept. Both pieces inhabit the realm of abstract glitch techno. The first features tightly defined sound structures laid out as a clearly readable tree of audio channels and modulations (see figure 2), while the second explores generative, self-modulating processes, resulting in an even more entangled, rhizomatic patch topology.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_95.pdf,,,95.jpg,,,

More recently, similar criticisms have been directed at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) community for its relative silence on contemporary political issues. However, it is possible that an implicit ethics of material culture is already embedded within NIME discourse — one that could be critically examined and potentially mobilized as a foundation for a more explicitly political ethics. Inspired by feminist discourse, namely Karen Barad's theory of agential realism, and contextualized through Bruno Latour's remarks regarding the ethics of design, this paper explores the possibilities of entanglement in DMI design. We begin with a discussion of diffraction and entanglement followed by a brief overview of values-oriented and ""world-building"" theoretical models and methodologies of design research.

The resulting audio-visual feedback can be interacted with by modifying camera and microphone positions and parameters, which influences simultaneously generated, perfectly synchronized sonic and visual structures.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_126.pdf,,,126.jpg,,,

The device consists of eight conductive water-level sensors in a custom 3D printed container. As a musician moves the device, it generates a chaotic flow of water within the container and translates the motion into real-time midi signals for audio-visual interpretation. In our initial performances and tests with the Aquapella, we have focused on turning the flowing characteristics of the device into ambient and glitch soundscapes that move between noise and harmonics.

This paper explores how a soft, textile-based interface can reshape human-AI interaction, particularly in musical co-creation. We introduce a textile-based human-AI system used both for musical performance and public interaction. This system enables embodied, tactile engagement with an AI agent, offering users a more unique and participatory experience in human-AI musical co-creation. We aim to examine the potential for soft materiality to mediate more dynamic human-AI interactions. Our findings reveal that users’ choices when interacting with novel systems are informed by their expectations and biases, that embodied learning is built iteratively on layered multi-sensory experiences, and that there is a desire for familiarity and understanding when interacting with AI systems. We found that the materiality of our textile human-AI interfaces influenced how users choose to interact, and that users sought clarity in the AI’s role in collaborative creation. This work contributes to our understanding of how entanglement, embodiment, and materiality impact our relationships in human-AI collaborations.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_41.pdf,,,131.jpg,,,

The 2025 ‘Entangled’ theme celebrates this diversity of creative, technical, and social ‘intelligencings’ (Thrift [68, p153-154]). It is precisely the non- or pluri-paradigmatic character of NIME that is its strength. Drawing on Maria Lugones [41], we characterise NIME less as an entangled weave—where threads maintain their separate yet assembled and interconnected character—than as a ‘curdling’ where relationships are more complex, varied, mutually interrupting and shaping, indeterminate and unknown without careful dialogue. We do not consider it appropriate to offer unifying frameworks or mappings with often hidden authoritarian implications. Rather, following Rancière [5], we prefer a radically democratic dissensus and, following Lugones, a spirit of ‘festive resistance’ where we poke at the limits of our inherited metaphors to undermine attempts to provide a fixed orderliness, (re)framing topics to kickstart exchange on new fertile grounds for collaboration. Multiple kinds and collisions of agency, and the lively openness of what some might deem ‘failure’ are prioritised over the often inhibiting closure and certainty of ‘success’ [e.g. 10, 11, 12, 40]. Our topics include: multiple ways of making as a means of maximising exposure to possible failure; shifting from interfaces to interfacing to create arenas for action rather than tools for purposes; foregrounding risk, inefficiency and forgetting; formulating improvisation as knowing-when and composing-the-now; performance practice, settings and contingencies; alternative resourcings/reframings for research; a wild spirit of tactical oppositionalism, dynamic uncompromise, and existential pluralism, to embrace the independence of divergent voices.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_42.pdf,,,134.jpg,,,

For centuries, shadows have captivated humanity’s imagination, and this project follows many artists, philosophers, and researchers equally captivated by the potential of shadows and silhouettes. This interface consists of a semi-translucent screen embedded with light-detecting sensors. These sensors register the movement of the violinist’s shadow and produce data that can be mapped to generate, trigger, or process sound in Max/MSP. The Shadow Harvester turns a human shadow into a real-time, life-size avatar, splitting the attention of the violinist between their shadow self and carnal self. They are ensnared in a web of sensors that require the same attention as the visceral joints in their body because any movement carries sonic repercussions through either their physical body playing the violin or their shadow body “playing” this interface. The Shadow Harvester creates a highly entangled feedback loop between the violinist, centuries of violin performance practice, and composition. As such, it carries the potential to encourage new ways of incorporating movement into the folds composition, notation, and performance.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_43.pdf,,,135.jpg,,,

Rather, the reenactment presents a novel instrument, realized through contemporary means, reflecting on contemporary concerns and within a contemporary context. We find reenactment complementary to conservation, maintenance, reconstruction and emulation in working with archival and museum objects. Our paper presents an analytic framework developed for use in workshop scenarios. This series of questions helps determine and understand which aspects of an instrument might be reenacted. To illustrate the process in action, we describe an example workshop wherein participants use methods of media archaeology, design fiction and role playing to imagine and reenact new features, affordances, contexts and applications of electronic instruments from a museum exhibition.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_44.pdf,,,137.jpg,"Pär Fredin / The Swedish Museum of Performing Arts, used with

To help answer this question we designed and developed a new device, which uses interface metaphors borrowed from analogue synthesisers and audio mixing to physically control the intangible aspects of a Large Language Model. We compared two versions of the device, with and without the audio-inspired augmentations, with a group of artists who used each version over a one week period. Our results show that the use of audio-like controls afforded more immediate, direct and embodied control over the LLM, allowing users to creatively experiment and play with the device over it's non-mixer counterpart.

145,music,Installation,,"installations-1, installations-2",,,,In person,Glass and Fans: Spatial Infra-Instrument Framework,Melanie Buntine; Anthony Lyons; Heather Gaunt; Eugene Ughetti,"This installation explores the entangled relationships between technology, creativity, accessibility, and participation through Glass and Fans, two interactive spatial sound installations developed using the Spatial Infra-Instrument Framework (SIF). 

Rooted in Percy Grainger’s vision to “blur the distinctions between performance, composition, and listening”[7], SIF transforms everyday materials—such as glass and fans—into versatile instruments, enabling participatory engagement for composers, performers, and the public, regardless of prior musical or technical experience.

As described by Hugill, Grainger “foresaw that bricolage, often using fairly cheap and readily available technologies, would become central to ... a ‘democratic’ approach to music-making” [7] in comparison to observations from Roser et al. that “emerging technologies are often expensive and, therefore, initially limited to society’s richest. A key part of technological progress is making... these innovations affordable for everyone”[9].
SIF embodies the principles of:
• Flexibility; to bend and mold to individual artistic practices by utilising high performing, open-source toolkits such as openFrameworks to interpret real-time spatial data to endless amounts of actions
• Adaptability; we didn’t want to limit ourselves to the body as the input (e.g. hand-tracking, skeleton-tracking) so we decided on depth tracking which allows for multiple performers and/or objects as input
• Affordability; we selected the Kinect v1(USD 10 in 2025[6]) over cameras such as Intel Realsense (USD 272-499 in 2025[8]) for cost-efficiency to allow for multi-camera installations to run concurrently. In addition, the cost affords a freedom for ""hardware hacking""[5] should the urge arise.
• Accessibility; to both composer, regardless of technical ability and performer/s, regardless of musical knowledge
SIF is an effort to support the multilayered creative and technical contexts involved with building new instruments by aligning with an infra-instrument tenet of the building with the “deployment of few sensors”[4]. However, the framework is not solely focused on the technology itself, but fostering artistic and educational opportunities and communities for creating New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIMEs). Its dual performance modes — Machine Mode, in which the instruments autonomously perform preprogrammed compositions, and Human Mode, where audience interaction shapes the sonic output—reflect the evolving and reciprocal interactions between users, instruments, and environments.

Glass reimagines hand-blown glass percussion objects, drawing on Grainger’s experiments with “musical glasses”(Fig. 3, left). The sampling of a unique and historically important glass instrument collection and incorporation within the Spatial Instrument Framework enables new forms of engagement. For composers/performers or lay audience alike, movements trigger sonic explorations of the unique tonal and textural qualities of these fragile instruments, overcoming their inherent fragility through innovative sampling and interaction.

Fans repurposes computer fans into a matrix of sonic possibilities. Audience engagement with the fans generates and modulates electromagnetic frequencies, creating an immersive interplay of acoustic, electro-acoustic, and virtual sound layers.
Together, these installations highlight the entangled dynamics of interaction, materiality, and sound, embodying a creative dialogue that spans technology, heritage, and experimentation. By providing accessible frameworks for participatory engagement, SIF bridges the gap between professional and public music-making, fostering deeper connections between musicians, audiences, and the evolving possibilities of new technology.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_145.pdf,,,145.jpg,,,Lecture Theatre 2

These functions generate real-time auditory and visual feedback, providing a responsive learning environment aligned with the updated Korean music curriculum. The system not only enables student-centred exploration of Gugak's fluid structures but also supports educators through dynamic, visualized feedback tools.

The composition is written prior to performance using the ChucK music programming language. During the performance, a computer running this program interfaces with the modular synthesizer, converting signals from the code into voltage to drive oscillators and amplifiers in the system. The flexibility offered by the programmatic composition supports complex arrangements of phrases, sections, and modulating tuning systems, while the modular synthesizer provides the performer precise control over the sound through real-time manipulation of timbre-shaping parameters. In this way, ChucK acts as the “orchestration” or the “brain”, whereas the modular synthesizer is the “instrument” or the “body” of the piece. There are four sections—labeled as fragments—each written using a different EDO tuning: 5EDO, 7EDO, 31EDO, and 15EDO, respectively. Each tuning has been selected to suit the stylistic and textural qualities of its respective fragment, shaping both the compositional approach and the resulting sonic character.

Each ‘cicada’ comprises a temporal hierarchy of pulse trains modulating a carrier frequency, with a simple sonic spatialization algorithm applied to give the sense of immersion in the sound mass. The algorithm is implemented in the Extempore audiovisual programming language, and utilizes an architecture in which each sonic parameter is inherently stochastic, much as the sound production mechanisms of actual Cicadas exhibit natural variation.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_60.pdf,,,172.jpg,,,
178,music,Live Performance,,concert-1,,4,20,In person,Carpet Entanglement,Joseph Burgess,"Textile production, music, and technology are historically entangled. This performance explores the long-standing interaction between textile arts and musical practice through the carpet tufting gun as a novel electroacoustic interface. This historical connection underscores the deep-rooted interplay between material craft and sonic expression, which has continued to evolve alongside technological advancements. Carpet entanglement emphasises  the ongoing generative interplay between media and mediums highlighting the tufting gun as a site of embodied, material engagement.

By leveraging the tufting gun’s distinctive acoustic properties and electromechanical kinetics, this work reimagines the tool as a vehicle for structured musical composition and improvisation. The performance transforms the gun’s utilitarian form and mechanical expressive qualities—such as its rhythmic firing, material resonance, and tactile feedback—into a dynamic paletteof itinerant musical gestures. The tufting gun serves a dual role: as an acoustic sound source and as an interactive performance interface, bridging textile craft and experimental sound art.

Carpet Entanglement reinforces the existing connection between textiles, technology, and music, highlighting the tufting gun’s potential as a tool for artistic expression while situating it within a broader historical and technological narrative. Through this performance, the tufting gun becomes a mediator between the tactile, material world of textile production and the ephemeral, sonic world of music, embodying the interwoven processes of making and performing.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_178.pdf,,,178.jpg,,,Concert 1

The keyboard was commissioned for exhibition in a musical instrument museum to enhance the visitor experience by providing an interface to digitised versions of instruments within the collection. The replica balances the competing de- mands of historical authenticity, public accessibility, and preser- vation. It replicates the original instrument’s tactile feedback and mechanical resistance using historically informed construction techniques. Optical sensors integrated within the mechanism capture the jacks’ motion data, enabling MIDI message gener- ation. This work situates itself within broader discussions on the role of technology in museums.

182,music,Live Performance,,concert-3,,4,20,In person,"My sunset is your sunrise, yet we touch",Dirk Stromberg; Jocelyn  Ho; MIchal Seta,"In “My sunset is your sunrise, yet we touch,” we propose a three-way hybrid-telematic improvisation, by three displaced musicians, featuring 2 DMIs, and an acoustic-prepared piano. The musicians are located in Montreal, Singapore and Canberra at the NIME conference. This performance explores the concept of a multimedia meta-instrument, a collaborative process that integrates audio, video, projection, and lighting into a cohesive whole. The meta-instrument redefines presence and interaction, challenging traditional notions tied to physical co-location. Our approach draws on Karen Barad’s concept of touch as an entangled, relational act. Here, touch extends beyond the physical to encompass the mediated interplay of sound, visuals, gestures, and light across networked spaces. In this environment, the tactility of capacitive keys, the resonances of the prepared piano, and the shifting gestural logic of controller-based sound art merge into a dynamic, co-constitutive system. This telematic improvisation demonstrates how the tactile interactions with instruments, the resonances of sound, and the dynamic interplay of light and video create new forms of connectivity and shared expression across a blurring of physical and virtual spaces. Through this meta-instrument, we aim to push the boundaries of telematic collaboration and artistic interaction.

Given the prevalence of sensory over-responsivity (SOR) and under-responsivity (SUR) in ASD, traditional sensory interventions often fail to accommodate the highly individualized and fluctuating sensory needs of autistic individuals. The authors highlight the potential for multisensory NIME to address the diverse range of sensory needs, promoting emotional regulation and sensory balance through new creative musical opportunities and activities. This paper presents research in the form of a narrative review and comparative case study of recent NIME and sensory intervention research, exploring emerging approaches, rhythm-based interventions, generative algorithms, play-centered designs and other possibilities for enhancing sensory engagement and emotional regulation. Drawing on insights from 30 recent NIME papers, this research explores the boundaries of current approaches and seeks to establish an understanding of multisensory NIME for ASD. The research underscores the profound variability in sensory profiles for ASD, necessitating a shift from clinician-directed interventions to creative, inclusive, multisensory solutions.

The interaction design leverages the variability of smartphone audio latency and quality to generate distributed sound fields that resonate in real-time with the performance's central sonic themes (e.g. granulation, density, layering and spatial sound distribution). Ideally, the performance space should ideally be set up with an immersive ambisonic sound system for supporting low-frequency content and reinforcing the performer’s electronic sounds. Audience smartphones act as distributed sound sources, enabling a shared participatory instrument. This distributed design also mitigates the need for specialized hardware, making the experience accessible across diverse demographics and venues.

This process is complicated by the ill-defined nature of timbre and the complex relationship between synthesizer parameters and their sonic output. In this work, we focus on real-time timbre remapping with percussion instruments, combining technical development with practice-based methods to address these challenges. As a technical contribution, we introduce a genetic algorithm -- applicable to black-box synthesizers including VSTs and modular synthesizers -- to generate datasets of synthesizer presets that vary according to target timbres. Additionally, we propose a neural network-based approach to predict control features from short onset windows, enabling low-latency performance and feature-based control. Our technical development is grounded in musical practice, demonstrating how iterative and collaborative processes can yield insights into open-ended challenges in DMI design.

This project explores magnetic recording technology and digital analogues for recording and playback that are instead on spherical topology. This instrument expands the concept of the audio loop through a more tangible and randomized approach than traditional record playback techniques of tape, while maintaining a familiarity with historic techniques of audio looping and scrubbing. Through it, one can not only create linear time-loops but blends between different times of the recording non-sequentially. The size and mass of the spheres enhances the performative elements through the physics of inertia.

We attach inexpensive transducers and homemade piezo microphones to create feedback loops within the timber itself. The signal is minimally processed: there are no pre-recorded or synthesized sounds, only the natural frequencies of the wood reinforcing themselves and being amplified through a hand-made cajon. Xylocyclos is a portmanteau deriving from the Greek xylo (wood) and cyclos (cycle). Thinking carefully through the provenance, treatment, and materiality of our salvaged timber, we activate physical and poetic resonances across multiple cyclical scales. The sonic feedback operates at the scale of audible sound-waves. Moving the contact microphone mere millimeters can effect a profound shift in the overall sonic texture. We conceive of this as a sonic reimagination of microfluctuations within the natural environment, where minute variations in desert topology determine the way a rivulet chooses its course; where the play of sun and shadows determines the capacity of a plant to photosynthesize; where a pollinator’s peregrinations determine which plants propagate. At this broader ecological scale, we are also thinking about cycles of life and death: our branches are all biologically dead, all in a transitional phase between aliveness and total decomposition. Transplanted into a foreign environment, we practice an ethics of care in preparing the timber for performance. When reanimating the branches as sonic beings we emphasize their roles as co-performers. They are sonically unpredictable: even adorning them with the target-practice cans we found buried in the desert can generate a profusion of new sonorities and overtones. Rather than attempting to control the branches and their sonic output, we instead afford them a degree of agency, performing a non-hierarchical act of creative collaboration with these organic entities.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_227.pdf,,,227.jpg,,,27th

238,music,Live Performance,,concert-1,,3,10,In person,{riversynth},Leah Barclay; Toby Gifford,"{riversynth} is both an immersive performance and musical interface that mixes live hydrophone streams from six river systems with live processing through a gestural controlled water instrument. Building on a decade of research from the River Listening project, {riversynth} creates an entangled performance ecosystem where unpredictable aquatic soundscapes become both the source material and score for a live performance. The interface consists of a transparent tank filled with water and embedded sensors that detect water movement and light. These parameters modulate, filter and mix the live hydrophone streams via the performer’s hands in the water, creating a dynamic relationship between the real-time river soundscapes and the performer's physical manipulation of water. {riversynth} demonstrates multiple layers of entanglement: temporal (connecting historical River Listneing research with real-time audio), spatial (linking geographically distant river ecosystems in a spatial performance environment), and material (using water to control and mix aquatic soundscapes). This multilayered approach directly engages with NIME 2025's theme by exploring how musical interfaces can bridge environmental monitoring with live artistic experimentation. The technical implementation combines custom-designed sensors, a low-latency streaming network, and a granular synthesis performance tool for live manipulation of the hydrophone streams in surround sound. The interface enables intuitive control while maintaining complexity in the sonic output, allowing for both composed sections and improvisatory responses to the unpredictability of live streams. {riversynth} creates an entangled network where environmental data becomes musical material, and human gestural control is mediated through live engagement with the hydrophones. This creates a feedback loop between performer, technology, and environment that emphasises our interconnected relationship with aquatic ecosystems and their health. While the performers appear to have agency through their gestural engagement with the water, it is ultimately the live river soundscapes that dictate and control how the performance will unfold, mirroring the unpredictability of the natural environment.

By combining spatial audio, ergonomic first-person gestural control, and networked interactivity, these interfaces can facilitate expressive, interesting, and emotionally resonant performances. Unlike data gloves and hyperinstruments, XR headsets can be calibrated to the physical properties of their individual users. However, these headsets tend to obscure the eyes and other parts of the face, limiting the user’s capacity to establish eye contact and transmit facial expressions. These subtle communicative elements play a crucial role in real-world collaborative musical settings where performers utilize facial cues to negotiate surface parameters such as timing, dynamics, and breath, as well as more complex qualities like atmosphere and interpretive mimesis. In this remote performance, we present the Screenless Optical Theremin with Tremolo (ScOTT), a novel gestural MIDI controller powered by a modified screenless XR headset. ScOTT focuses on the hands and arms, mapping broad gestures to coarse-grained musical parameters (e.g. pitch and velocity) and small movements to more complex musical ornaments (e.g. tremolo width and frequency). In a structured improvisation that highlights the role of ornament in musical texture, we explore the ScOTT’s capacity to balance social presence, embodied interaction, and expressivity.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_243.pdf,,,243.jpg,,,
244,workshop,,,workshops-1,,,,,Entangled Bowing: Integrating the MetaBow into Spatialized Composition and Real-Time DSP,Roberto Alonso Trillo; Davor Vincze; Peter AC Nelson,"This workshop explores the integration of the MetaBow (Alonso Trillo et al., 2024), a sensor-embedded violin bow, into compositional practice, sound spatialization, and real-time DSP processing. The MetaBow, developed to maintain the ergonomics of a traditional violin bow while providing high resolution motion data, opens new possibilities for mapping gestural input to spatial audio processing and digital synthesis techniques.

Participants will engage in hands-on experimentation with different mapping strategies, leveraging accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and sensor fusion data to drive spatial trajectories, control DSP effects, and shape real-time sonic transformations. 

The workshop will cover:

Introduction to the MetaBow: design, sensor technology, and integration.
Mapping Strategies: from direct parameter mapping to machine learning-based gesture classification.
Spatialization Techniques: using bowing data to drive multi speaker diffusion, binaural processing, and ambisonics.
Real-Time DSP Control: applying sensor data to modulate synthesis, spectral processing, and live electronics.
Collaborative Improvisation: participants will explore interactive performance scenarios, integrating bow gestures with sound diffusion in a networked environment.

This workshop is designed for musicians, composers, and digital instrument designers interested in expanding their performative and compositional language through motion tracking and spatial sound. Participants will leave with a set of tools and techniques for embedding bow performance data into dynamic, responsive musical systems.

No prior experience with MetaBow is required, though familiarity with Max/MSP, SuperCollider, or other real-time processing environments will be beneficial. A limited number of MetaBow units will be provided for hands-on exploration.

Dannenberg,"We introduce Automatic Drum TapScription (ADTS), a novel paradigm for rhythmic interaction consisting of transcribing arbitrarily-timbred taps into drum representations. Our approach targets taps produced on a variety of surfaces without other controlled timbral characteristics other than playing style. Our long-term goal is to enable more accessible and creative percussive exploration but presents significant challenges due to the minimal timbre variation between taps intended to represent different drum classes. To address these challenges, we take the first steps toward achieving ADTS by designing an effective dataset synthesis strategy. This strategy enables new opportuneties for musical expression by considering drumming at a more semantic or functional level as opposed to a simple collection of timbres. We present initial results, comparing three different models: one trained on drum data, another trained on a small dataset of quasi-aligned tapped performances, and another trained on our synthetic dataset. Our synthetic approach shows promise, demonstrating progress in this untapped domain.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_80.pdf,,,246.jpg,,,

Documentation feeds the knowledge and the values with which to evaluate and discuss current achievements and musical creations as well as to plan for the future. Besides publishing our research in conferences and journals, sharing research materials and outcomes like software, hardware, instruments, and datasets is important. This allows others to use the latest technology and improve it. For this purpose, the repository is increasingly commonly used by researchers and artists to store and share their works. However, creating repositories does not follow a clear and organised structure like the one we find, for example, in papers. The heterogeneity of repositories makes it hard to use both practically and for analysis. Although the variety and differences of research products in the field of new musical technologies are obvious, we believe that defining repositories with common guidelines could significantly improve the critical discourse in this area. This issue has been discussed at the NIME conference through workshops and papers. In this article, we want to continue this discussion and propose a flexible repository template to organise and present research materials and outcomes in the field of musical technologies research. The article provides a short and focused review of how repositories are currently used at the NIME conference, with special attention to the platforms used. Based on this study, we introduce a repository template that will be applied to case studies. We hope this proposal will encourage further discussion and advancement on this issue and, at the same time, support and facilitate the creation of new repositories.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_81.pdf,,,250.jpg,,,

Through a sustained six-month ethnographic engagement with five performers and two support artists, we explored how to create personalised instruments for a public per- formance outcome. The technical framework combined multiple wireless motion sensor devices placed inside different objects and the development of a real-time movement-to-sound pro- cessing hub within a live coding environment. The performance was centred on an accessible sound sculpture, the Sound Tree, where digital instruments coexisted with traditional sound mak- ing objects. Drawing from our shared process of experimentation, improvisation, and personalised instrument creation, we present some key ‘magic moments’ that were woven into the final perfor- mance and discuss how they might serve as evidence of personal expression and validation of the design process. The emergence of these moments demonstrate the value of real-time system adaptation in encouraging individual expression, the importance of sustained engagement in developing personalised instruments and having effective strategies for balancing personal and collec- tive music-making.

Thinking beyond the paradigm of keyboard-and-screen-based interfaces, this project is based on previous work on the Drumball. By converting rhythmic input into multimodal output, it creates an entangled ecosystem where the human body, digital musical instruments, and the Internet of Things intersect. Such a digital orality system could offer parents and practitioners a novel method for introducing children to literacy, STEAM skills and multimodal communication in the early years. I present design iterations of 1) a tangible rhythmic interface for digital drum talk inspired by the style of play of the Djembe, 2) a protocol for sending piezo sensor outputs over a custom PCB shield, which can be recognized across multiple platforms and web-based environments without additional customization; and 3) a suite of rhythm-based learning games using the Alphariddims multimodal symbol system based on the Morse code.

Bilateral movement techniques, widely used in trauma therapy [3], [4], engage both hemispheres of the brain, promoting bodily unification and focused attention [5], [6], [7]. This work integrates trauma-informed movement practices with wearable gestural music technology to explore sonic representations of psychological states in a multi-channel spatial audio environment. The performance sonifies panic through asymmetric arm and hand movements, breath-based vocalizations, and visual projections that depict physiological dysregulation. Datagloves capture movement data, modulating live and sampled breath sounds to create a dynamically evolving soundscape. Visual projections, generated in real-time, use torus meshes that expand and contract — an analogy to hemoglobin’s role in oxygen transport (see Fig 1.). The integration of movement, sound, and visuals reinforces the connection between breath, blood flow, and the body’s autonomic responses. As Adriana Cavarero notes, “Nothing more than the act of breathing is able to testify to the proximity of human beings to one another; nothing else better confirms their communication…” to signify the essence of being alive [8, p. 31].

Through midline-crossing and sequenced movement patterns, the performer traces a path from psychological fragmentation to unity. MiMU datagloves capture gestural movement in real time, transforming hand and arm motions into a layered soundscape of live vocal sampling. Open-hand gestures extend outward and draw inward, mapping to sustained melodic lines, while bird-like formations—fingers flexing and unfolding—trigger harmonic layers and spatialized echoes. Prayer-hand movements send reverberant waves through the sound field, reinforcing themes of unity and self-reintegration. Real-time particle cloud projections, generated from movement data, swirl and converge around the performer, evoking shamanic ritual and animist traditions.

These tools exist in various forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems, each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others allow pitch selection via an external keyboard–both approaches demanding some degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for real-time implementations.

The misalignments and errors that occur in the process of imitation and the dynamic changes in the relationship between the performers caused by the interveners (the System Jockey and the Intervener) are intertwined to produce unpredictable movements and sounds. Performers wear special suits equipped with gyro-sensors and exciters. The gyro-sensor converts the postural movement data into vibrations, which are transmitted to the exciter of the other performer. The performers respond to these vibrations and move, mimicking each other's postures. As this chain of imitation is repeated, errors and misalignments due to tactile perception, physical ability, initial position, differences in posture, spatial constraints, and other factors accumulate, and new movements emerge. In this work, all sounds are generated from the performers' movements. Contact microphones are attached to the performers' suits to capture the sound generated by their movements. The sounds are processed and output, and electronic sounds are generated from its volume information, so that the relationships between the performers and the changes in their movements can be expressed sonically. The relationships among the performers, and the interaction between the system and the performance environment generate the performers' movements and sounds, and the system jockey and the intervener intervene in these interactions. The result is an improvisational performance in which nonlinear changes in movement and sound are intertwined with intentional control. “transcriptions” is a work that presents a new form of improvisational expression by actively utilizing creative emergence through chains of imitation.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_265.pdf,,,265.jpg,,,

An online survey was conducted to examine the differences in experiences between digital and physical albums, and this informed the development of a physical music album incorporating AR. We provided 8 K-POP fans, who engage with physical albums more frequently than fans of other genres, the opportunity to test existing AR-integrated albums and a new prototype featuring AR packaging animations, multiplayer virtual concerts, and interactive photo features. The results underscored the importance of understanding and respecting fan culture when using AR. The results suggest that, compared to digital albums, physical albums derive significant experiential value from traditional supplementary materials such as booklets and lyric cards.

Our project, Dinosaur Choir, realizes musical instruments that bring these vocalizations back to life using CT (Computational Tomography) scans, 3D fabrication, and physically-based modeling synthesis. Musicians and gallery visitors give voice to these dinosaur instruments by blowing into a mouthpiece, exciting a computational voice box, and resonating the sound through the recreated dinosaur’s fossilized nasal cavities and skull. When the participant blows into the microphone, their breath becomes the dinosaur’s breath. However, the dinosaur does not have flesh, only bone. They are interacting with and seeing the process of millions of years of decay and change in the instrument. While science is one way of knowing dinosaurs, this work explores how a musical instrument can also generate knowledge. Dinosaur Choir also delves deeper into science, filling the unknowns with informed speculation and imagination.

Our work explores the Corythosaurus, a duck-billed dinosaur with a large, hollow crest housing complicated nasal passages that scientists hypothesize were used for vocal call resonation. Dinosaur Choir begins with this hypothesis but expands its exploration into the unknown vocal boxes, sensorimotor systems, and behaviors that allow vocalization to occur. The project represents a deep collaboration between music, computation, paleontology, and the imagination to explore the intersection of what we know and we may never discover. We have collaborated and consulted with paleontologists to produce this work as well as researching specimens ourselves in university and museum collections. We also explore the dinosaur skull as a wind instrument, iterating on the musical interaction to improve the intimacy and responsiveness of the experience. We focus on breath to drive air pressure into the computational model and we capture the mouth shape of the musician via optical motion capture to determine the stretch and muscle pressure of the vocal folds.

These data structures allow users to organize musical information sequentially and hierarchically in ways that reflect familiar conventions of Western music notation. SMucK supports data interchange with formats like MusicXML and MIDI, enabling users to import notated scores and performance data into SMucK data structures. SMucK also introduces SMucKish, a compact high-level input syntax, designed to be efficient, human-readable, and live-codeable. The SMucK playback system extends ChucK’s strongly-timed mechanism with dynamic temporal control over real-time audio synthesis and other systems including graphics and interaction.

288,music,Live Performance,,concert-7,,3,30,In person,Tesseract,Vijay Thillaimuthu,"Tesseract is a live audiovisual work for the superimposition of lasers and video projections as controlled by sound. The same voltage that is amplified as sound, derived from a modular synthesiser and theremin controller, also deflects laser light into visible patterns and becomes the source for real-time video projections. The different display technologies are then mapped together to present a unified experience.

Tesseract is designed to provoke a questioning of the mechanisms of perception, creating interactions between two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualisations. The work is developed in reference to the tesseract, a four-dimensional hypercube beyond our ability to properly visualise, analogous to what a three-dimensional cube is to a two-dimensional square. Tesseract is inspired by notions of quantum processes that take place across dimensions, unable to be perceived, and scarcely understood. We commonly use complex power and communication networks without understanding their processes in totality. For example, transistors use quantum tunnelling while lasers use the stimulated emission process, where photons essentially teleport when interacting with excited electrons (to create laser light). These are phenomena that can only be explained through theoretical physics. This is an ambitious work pushing the possibilities of existing technologies. This work imagines interaction with forces beyond our understanding.
The system has been developed on the principle of Vector Synthesis or Oscilloscope Music, whereby the stereo image of the sound signal articulates the left and right axes of a graphical image on a Cartesian plane. The performer interacts with the system and decides whether to disrupt or accept the generative potential of the system. As both the projections and laser images are derived from the same source, sound voltage, they can be seamlessly connected.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_288.pdf,,,288.jpg,,,26th black box
291,paper,poster,short,posters-3,,,5,remote,Melia: An Expressive Harmonizer at the Limits of AI,Matthew Caren; Joshua Bennett,"We present Melia, a harmonizer-like digital instrument that explores how common failure modes of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) systems can be used in expressive and musical ways. The instrument is anchored by an audio-to-audio neural network trained on a hand-curated dataset to perform pitch-shifting and dynamic filtering. Biased training data and poor out-of-distribution generalization are deliberately leveraged as musical devices and sources of instrument-defining idiosyncrasies. Melia features a custom hardware interface with a MIDI keyboard that polyphonically allocates instances of the model to harmonize live audio input, and integrated hardware controls that manipulate model parameters and various audio effects in real-time. This paper presents an overview of related work, the instrument's hardware and software, and how audio-to-audio AI models might fit into the long-standing tradition of musicians, artists, and instrument-makers finding inspiration in a medium's shortcomings.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_93.pdf,,,291.jpg,,,

The direct sound from the parametric speakers has a super narrow directivity, which creates the sensation that the sound field is close by, as well as tactile auditory stimulation. It is also easily reflected by walls and objects, creating a virtual sound source on the spot.

In this work, parametric speakers are attached to both palms and shins of the performer and made wireless, making the sound source mobile. The composer also remotely selects and adjusts the parameters of the sound source played from the parametric speakers.

This allows the performer to move between the audience, changing the distance and direction from the  audience and the wall, creating a movement  of the sound image. In addition, the switching between direct and reflected sound creates an auditory experience in which the localization changes abruptly.

In this work, the choreography of the performers and the music are composed in parallel, for example, by taking advantage of the changes in pitch created by the high-speed movement of the parametric speakers.
The movement of the performer changes the hearing, response, and relationship between the performer themselves, the composer, and the viewer, bringing to light a more complex sound source movement and improvisational acoustic experience.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_292.pdf,,,292.jpg,,,Drama Theatere

This paper investigates the emerging concept of ""digital physics"" in MR, where digital objects, as informational entities, shape both cognitive and somatic experiences. Building on the ""somatic turn"" in human-computer interaction, we explore how the human body, as a site of interaction, adapts to new forms of embodied collaboration in MR spaces. Through the lens of contact improvisation, we introduce GravField, a live performance-based MR system that uses Audio-Visual Virtual Mediators (AVVMs) to facilitate interdependent behaviors among participants. These AVVMs incorporate metaphors such as springs, ropes, and magnetic fields, shaping bodily movement and social dynamics through dynamic, sensory feedback. Drawing from post-phenomenological theories, this research examines the relationships between embodiment, interpretation, alterity, and background in the context of MR. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how digital objects mediate embodied interaction and collective behavior, offering practical insights for designing entangled and embodied experiences in MR environments.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_293.pdf,,,293.jpg,,,

The installation extends our work with an ultrasonic technology that sonifies and magnifies the physical entanglement of a listener with a spatial sound field to produce rich movement-sound interaction without the use of sensors. Taking a research through practice approach, we examine the process of creating 'Sonographies' while deliberately allowing the nonhuman influences of site and technology to inform creative ideation and decision-making. We propose that an attunement to entanglement foregrounds the co-production of aesthetic qualities by the entire musical assemblage and fosters a sensitivity to fragile and changeable qualities of NIMEs, contingent on specific technical, material and social situations.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_94.pdf,,,295.jpg,,,

The interface consists of several spherical objects in different colours orbiting around the centrally placed static object on the spacetime fabric. The spherical objects are launched at a certain angle from the setup's periphery, and the objects' motion is tracked by an overhead camera and mapped to different parameters to generate sound. In GraviTone, users can experience sounds generated from objects’ parameters and have control over different configurations. We use the setup to send Open Sound Control (OSC) signals and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) signals to map different sounds and musical scales (Indian classical ragas and Western classical scale). We mapped the moving objects’ parameters to control synth parameters, VSTs, and DAWs. Users can also route generated MIDI data into DAWs using preset configurations or customizing their frameworks for sound generation. We also generate real-time visuals corresponding to the object's movements for further immersion and interactivity. This integrated interface combines various domains like musical mathematics, sonification techniques, sound synthesis, and sound design for live music creation and real-time audiovisual composition.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_95.pdf,,,300.jpg,,,
302,music,Live Performance,,concert-5,,6,6,In person,Mulholland Revisited,Héloïse Garry,"This project explores the intersection of real-time algorithmic sound generation and live piano performance through ChucK and MIDI-based interaction. Inspired by the interplay between dream and reality in David Lynch’s ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001), the piece utilizes a series of ChucK scripts that dynamically respond to the pianist’s input, shaping an evolving soundscape. The system employs MIDI-triggered processes to generate and manipulate electronic textures in real-time, expanding the piano’s expressive range beyond its traditional acoustic boundaries.

The work is structured around four key sonic gestures, each corresponding to a moment in ""Mulholland Drive"": (1) a synthesized telephone bell signifying Diane’s psychological rupture, (2) a dynamically generated arpeggio that mirrors the tension of her conversation with Camilla, and (3-4) progressively complex textural layers that blur the line between live performance and algorithmic sound synthesis. 

By integrating reactive electronic sound with live piano, this piece demonstrates how real-time programming can transform the piano from a traditional interface into a multidimensional, interactive system. ",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_302.pdf,,,302.jpg,,,

This approximately 6-minute performance aligns primarily with solarpunk aesthetics, offering a critical contemplation of electronic art, sustainability, and collective eco-consciousness through audience interaction and connection.

At the heart of this performance is the Solar Punk Console, a solar-powered capacitive synthesizer that embodies the solarpunk ethos of sustainable technology and community interconnectedness. This synthesizer not only harnesses solar energy but also invites audience participation, as conductive threads connected to the Solar Punk Console’s synthesis control inputs are deployed into the audience during performance. Participants are encouraged to hold, manipulate, or pass these threads, forming a complex electronic circuit within the performance venue. This interaction directly impacts both the audio output and the visual atmosphere of the performance space using audiovisual processing software created in Max. This piece utilizes feedback in both audio and visual systems to blur the lines between performer, audience, and environment, as collective actions of the audience shape a interwoven synesthetic sensory experience in real-time.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_307.pdf,,,307.jpg,,,"25, 26, not 27"

Here, the simulation not only governs the motion of the balls in the visual domain but also determines the musical outcome of the piece in the auditory domain, thereby providing a unique cross-modal experience for both the audience and the performer. In addition to the fact that this piece may invoke intriguing discussions in terms of simulation-based algorithmic composition, it is especially noteworthy that it is a unique amalgamation of a fixed, deterministic set of musical notes and partly uncertain, indeterministic follow-ups generated by computer simulation in the visual domain. Although the exact time and the frequency of occurrence of musical events are chance-based and effectively random, they are perfectly relevant to the motion of the ball presented simultaneously. Regarding the musical organization of the piece, the artists focus on exploring a wide range of parameter combinations, keep evaluating the musical versatility of the system employed, and hope to bring more unique outcomes to the stage at the conference than those featured in the accompanying video.",https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_310.pdf,,,310.jpg,,,

While spatial audio technologies have been widely applied across various domains, there are few opportunities in daily life to consciously perceive the boundary between personal and external space. Due to its physical structure and everyday usage, the umbrella has a unique ability to render such boundaries perceptible. Focusing on the “flow” of raindrops across the umbrella’s surface, the system detects continuous rain movement in real time rather than merely capturing impact sounds. Spatial auditory feedback encourages users to actively perceive dynamic spatial boundaries, as the rain draws auditory contours through interaction with the umbrella. To this end, the umbrella is conceptualized as an interactive interface that senses raindrop movement and applies spatial audio processing. In addition, users can dynamically alter the virtual size of the umbrella, enabling perceptual shifts in spatial scale. Rather than treating the umbrella as a mere protective object, this system reimagines it as a medium for perceiving environmental change through sound. By integrating natural phenomena with spatial audio, this approach suggests new directions for embodied perception and expression.",https://nime.org/proceedings/2025/nime2025_96.pdf,,,323.jpg,,,

Motivated by global discussions of socio-technical change and recent Australian legislative lobbying, this short-form, 3-hour workshop targets the commodification of cultural labour and current entanglements between social, political, corporate and technological actors in the music industry. The objective of this workshop is to hold a critically minded discussion between panellists from the Australian music sector and NIME colleagues, grappling with these sociotechnical imperatives both generally, across the industry, and particularly, within the context of live performance. The workshop offers an overview that survey’s sociotechnical change and AI use across global music industries and invites critical discussion of:

- Key political-economic concerns in the music sector
- Proposed frames for the NIME research community to engage with industry and develop strategies for ethical AI adoption
- Directions for future discourses, policy considerations and further dialogues of sociotechnical transformation in the music industry

Discussions between panellists and attendees will be guided by three questions:

- How to frame the political-economic changes that have been taking place in global music cultures, including but not limited to those involving AI and live virtualisation technologies.
- How the NIME research community interfaces with music cultures beyond academia in an age of AI, particularly in the development of live music technologies.
- What blind sports are being neglected by the current trajectory of political, industrial and academic discourses.

Joining us will be local music industry experts:
Aakanksha Sidhu

In particular, many practitioners within NIME (and beyond) have adopted techniques, concepts, and tools from soma design—a methodology that centers the focus of design on the soma, i.e., the body, the lived experience, and first-person perspectives on embodied phenomena. In this workshop, we aim to gather with artists, designers, researchers, musicians, and creative practitioners at NIME to provide them with a platform to: (1) learn about soma design in NIME and musicking through our two keynotes, and group of expert panelists, (2) share their experiences of employing somatic/somaesthetic techniques to guide their creative choices, and how they are producing knowledge in the form of methods, tools, and concepts in this space, and (3) network with other like-minded researchers and practitioners who share a common body-centric perspective on design, interaction, and performance.",,,,335.jpg,,,Skaidrite Darius N108

We propose a workshop on generative AI systems for live music, focusing on enabling a user's musical expression. This workshop will discuss recognizing human motions and gestures through a camera and real-time audio generation.

338,workshop,,,workshops-1,,,,,MoNoDeC: The Mobile Node Controller Platform,Nick Hwang; Anthony Marasco,"MoNoDeC is a multichannel audio system that uses audience mobile phones and IoT-hardware-driven speakers as point sources for configurable and dynamic immersive audio speakers and audience performance interfaces. Audience participants register their current location within a customizable audience space diagram on their mobile phones. Their phones then become a point source speaker within the immersive experience. A person designated as the performance/installation ‘controller’ sends audio, control, and interface data to participants throughout the experience. In addition to diffusing audio to mobile devices, MoNoDeC can include embedded computer instruments known as ‘autonomous hubs’: IoT-based speakers that receive playback/diffusion data. These autonomous hubs are meant to be used in larger sound diffusion performance settings as well as installation/fixed point source scenarios in conjunction with audience-provided devices. 

This workshop will lead participants on setting up the MoNoDeC system, designing registration and location-choosing presets for audience members to engage with, and methods for panning audio around the networked mobile device speaker array during a live composition. Participants will also learn the basics of Collab-Hub, our framework for sharing control data between networked telematic performers that serves as the backbone of MoNoDeC. After learning the core features of both systems, participants will form groups and design short immersive compositions using the framework. participants will set up the MoNoDec system, design registration and location-choosing presets for audience members to engage with, and explore methods for panning audio around the networked mobile device speaker array during a live composition. At the end of the session, participants will form groups and design short immersive compositions using the system. ",,,,338.jpg,,,Hanna Neumann 3.41

Through various entanglement theories of human-technology relations, we can understand listening as a Baradian apparatus that motivates, propels, and evaluates the design of new musical instruments. Further, we can use listening practices as a method to de-center the human. We propose a workshop primed by emerging theories in sound studies to critically examine how listening appears, how it functions, and how it performs. Through guided mediations, hands-on exercises, and prompted discussion, we aim to integrate a plurality of listening experiences and suggest tuning our listening toward more entangled design practices.
