We invite you to be a part of NIME2025, _entangled NIME_, the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression. NIME2025 will take place at The Australian National University, Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country, Canberra, Australia with support for in-person and remote presentation.

We invite submissions of new scholarly and creative works in the following categories:

- Paper (6000-, 4000-, and 2000-word lengths)
- Music (live performance, installation, remote)
- Workshop

All NIME submissions are made through CMT (link TBA) and use the NIME Template: <https://github.com/NIME-conference/nime-template>. 
We encourage submitters to use the LaTeX templates and tools such as Overleaf where possible.

Submission deadlines are and full information for each category of submission can be found at: <https://nime2025.org/call/>

We particularly wish to encourage submissions from artists and scholars who are women, queer, or gender diverse, are First Nations people, young/emerging, historically marginalised, have a disability or are Deaf, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions. We suggest joining the [NIME Forum](https://forum.nime.org/) where you are able to get updates and support from the NIME2025 committee and community in developing your submission.

We note that travel is not required to publish and present work at NIME 2025. Decoupling publication and travel supports inclusive participation in our field. The calls below include requirements for remote participation. We note that NIME submissions (papers, music, workshops) are subject to the [NIME Principles & Code of Practice on Ethical Research](https://nime.org/ethics/) and ask all submitters to consider accessibility implications that may be relevant to their proposals. We welcome conversations regarding accessibility potential of submissions.
