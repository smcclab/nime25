<h2><a name="q1">How do I communicate accessibility needs to NIME 2025 organizers?</a></h2>

<p>The Accessibility Chair for NIME 2025 is Alexander Hunter, whose goal is to ensure the conference is accessible to everyone. After you register for the conference, there will be an online form with a question labeled "Do you have a disability or special need which requires our awareness?". In your response, please indicate any accessibility needs such as wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, or a guide. The Accessibility Chair will follow up with you to clarify your needs. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:Alexander.Hunter@anu.edu.au">Alexander.Hunter@anu.edu.au</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="q2">Who do I ask if my question is not answered here?</a></h2>

<p>Concerts at NIME involve loud music, stage lighting, and projected visuals.

Please get in touch with the accessibility chair if you have any specific concerns regarding sensory impact at NIME.</p>

<p>Please contact Alexander Hunter at <a href="mailto:Alexander.Hunter@anu.edu.au">Alexander.Hunter@anu.edu.au</a> as early as possible if you have further questions or special requests.</p>


<h2><a name="q21">Will there be a designated quiet space at the conference?</a></h2>

Please contact us if you are planning to attend the conference and may need such a space. </p>

<h2><a name="q19">What if I have a medical emergency or health problem during the conference?</a></h2>

<p>In case of emergency call <a href="tel:000">000</a> for an ambulance. 6km by car/bus (North Canberra Hospital) or 13km away (Canberra Hospital) If you require non-urgent medical care, please contact Alexander Hunter at <a href="mailto:Alexander.Hunter@anu.edu.au">Alexander.Hunter@anu.edu.au</a> or ask any student volunteer. They will provide you with information about local doctors, specialists, chiropractors, etc. For non-resident attendees, buying travel insurance that covers medical expenses is strongly recommended as fees for emergency treatment can be very high.</p>
