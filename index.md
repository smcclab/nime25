[**New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)**](https://nime.org), is an international conference about new musical interfaces, their artistic use and the technologies involved in building them. Researchers from all over the world share their knowledge and late breaking work during the conference. The conference started as a workshop at the CHI conference in 2001 and, since then, has been held annually around the world.

## A bit about _entangled NIME_

The theme of NIME2025 is _**­entangled NIME**_. This theme recognises the multilayered contexts of activity and impact involved in music making with new technology. In an era where music creation and performance are increasingly intertwined with social, cultural, and environmental factors, entanglement emphasises how musical interfaces are not simply tools but active agents in the complex web of human and technological relationships. From personal expression to collective experiences, from creative spontaneity to long-term artistic evolution, entangled NIME seeks to explore how new musical interfaces shape, and are shaped by, the environments, communities, and individuals they engage.
 
Through this lens, we invite researchers, artists, and technologists to reflect on how musical interfaces not only respond to immediate user input but also evolve with the musician over time, adapt to diverse cultural practices, and dynamically interact with the broader societal and ecological landscapes. Whether it’s the integration of AI as a co-creator, the ethical considerations of sustainable design, or the incorporation of gestures and environmental factors into performance, the entangled NIME theme calls for deeper examination of the reciprocal and non-linear interactions that emerge between musicians, technologies, and the worlds they inhabit.

## A bit about Canberra

**Canberra** is a small but culturally energetic city holding many of Australia’s cultural institutions. The ANU has a history of engagement with electronic and computer art and music through scholarship, artistic fellowships, and education. The ANU is active in addressing important social issues in Australia such as a commitment to below zero carbon usage and engagement with and celebration of First Nations people.

## Inclusion and Accessibility at NIME

In addition to showcasing the best of international NIME-related research, scholarship and artistic investigation, NIME2025 will continue building a strong and inclusive scholarly computer music and art community in Australia. This is particularly important for supporting Australian and New Zealand researchers and artists who are young/emerging, historically disadvantaged, are Deaf, have a disability, are First Nations people or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.

We note that NIME submissions (papers, music, workshops) are subject to the [NIME Principles & Code of Practice on Ethical Research](https://nime.org/ethics/) and we ask all submitters to consider accessibility implications that may be relevant to their proposals. We welcome conversations regarding accessibility potential of submissions and look to ways to promote embedded accessibility in all that we do.
