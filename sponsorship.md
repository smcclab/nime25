## About NIME

**New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)** is an international conference about new musical interfaces, their artistic use and the technologies involved in building them.

Researchers from all over the world share their knowledge and discoveries at the conference. The conference started as a workshop at theCHI conference in 2001 and, since then, has been held annually around the world.

[NIME2025 will be held from June 24—27, 2025, at the Australian National University, Canberra.](https://nime2025.org/)

The theme of NIME2025 is _**entangled NIME**_. 
This theme recognises the multilayered contexts of activity and impact involved in music making with new technology. 
From personal expression to collective experiences, from creative spontaneity to long-term artistic evolution, entangled NIME seeks to explore how new musical interfaces shape, and are shaped by, the environments,communities, and individuals they engage.
