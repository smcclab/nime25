This page (will) provide clear and consistent instructions for preparing your accepted or conditionally accepted work for the conference. You will need to upload your updated submission document and you may have to submit other materials that will enable your work to be presented (e.g., for some forms of remote presentation).

The ["camera ready"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera-ready) version of your submission is the version that you will be presenting at the conference and will be archived in the [NIME Proceedings Archive](https://nime.org). Every accepted submission will be invited to submit a camera ready version of their accepted document [CMT]({{ cmt_link }}) by the camera ready deadline and **must do so** to be included in the conference (even if minimal or no changes are required).

{: .table }

Note that at a basic level we will provide a two-channel sound system and projection capabilities for all live/remote performances and installations. Performances requiring sptial audio or a Disklavier piano will be scheduled in concerts within our recording studio and will require some additional discussion to confirm arrangements.

We may be able to provide some additional equipment (e.g., DI boxes, XLR cables, power boards) that would be typically provided by a concert venue but this is subject to approval by the paper and general chairs. Specific equipment such as computers or interfaces cannot be provided by the conference.

We will provide time line/sound-checking all performances but ask that artists are as prepared as possible for a plug-and-play experience given the tight schedule of the conference.
