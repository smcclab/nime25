Our preferred way to get your questions answered is to post on the [NIME forum](https://forum.nime.org/c/conference/8) where the committee members (and others from community) can crowd source answers directly.

- If you have a question related to your NIME submission, you can send an email to all General Chairs from [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NIME2025/Submission/Index) by clicking "Contact Chairs" in the bar at the top of the screen. You can contact your track chairs by clicking "Email Track Chair" shown in the track field for your submission.

- Accessibility concerns or questions should be directed to the [Accessibility Chair (Dr Alexander Hunter)](https://music.cass.anu.edu.au/people/dr-alexander-hunter): [alexander.hunter@anu.edu.au](mailto:alexander.hunter@anu.edu.au)

- General inquiries can be sent to [Charles Martin](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/charles-martin/): [charles.martin@anu.edu.au](mailto:charles.martin@anu.edu.au).

- We have information on [sponsorship (link)]({% link sponsorship.md %}) and enquiries should be directed to [Charles Martin](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/charles-martin/)
