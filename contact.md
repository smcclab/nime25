The best way to get your questions answered is to post on the [NIME forum](https://forum.nime.org/c/conference/8) where the committee members (and others from community) can crowd source answers directly.

- Accessibility concerns or questions should be directed to the [Accessibility Chair (Dr Alexander Hunter)](https://music.cass.anu.edu.au/people/dr-alexander-hunter)

Further contacts will be available in the coming months.
